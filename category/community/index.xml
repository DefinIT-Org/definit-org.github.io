Virtual conference event fatigue is real. I have attended and presented at many since the pandemic began, with varying levels of engagement. As an introvert, I can&amp;rsquo;t quite believe I&amp;rsquo;m saying this, but I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get pack to meeting up with people in the real world!
The value of a conference is super-charged by the mix of dedicated time, networking opportunities and quality live content.</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2020 and VMware {Code} Connect!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/09/vmworld-2020-and-vmware-code-connect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/09/vmworld-2020-and-vmware-code-connect/</guid><description>Where can you find me at VMworld 2020 VMworld 2020 - possible together VMworld 2020 is fast approaching (Sept 29th-October 1st), and in case you hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard, it online and free!

As part of the CMBU and a long-standing vExpert it made sense for me to help out, and I was happy to do so. I reviewed ~60 of the applications that were in my area - automation. The experience was an eye-opener. What follows is a distillation of what (not) to do when you&amp;rsquo;re writing your application.</description></item><item><title>vExpert 2020 holographic sticker charity giveaway!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/vexpert-2020-holographic-sticker-charity-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/vexpert-2020-holographic-sticker-charity-giveaway/</guid><description>TL;DR - the first 50 vExperts to sign up on this google sheet and then make a donation to my fundraiser here or another charity of your choice will get a nice shiny new vExpert 2020 sticker!

Firstly, I need to mention that I&amp;rsquo;m using three different repositories for my code base, and why. The three repositories are:
definit-hugo - this contains the hugo site configuration definit-content - this contains the site content - markdown files, images etc definit-theme - this contains the VMware Clarity-based theme I use for my site definit-content and definit-theme are git submodules in the definit-hugo project, mapped into the /content and /themes folders respectively.</description></item><item><title>2020 - Simon's decade in review</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</guid><description>So it being 2020 now I thought it would be a pleasant exercise to quickly glance over the previous ten years and reflect a little.

That article helped me relax into who I am from a professional point of view, but it also challenged me.
I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring temperature and humidity with a Raspberry Pi 3, DHT22 sensor, InfluxDB and Grafana</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/07/monitoring-temperature-and-humidity-with-a-raspberry-pi-3-dht22-sensor-influxdb-and-grafana/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:52:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/07/monitoring-temperature-and-humidity-with-a-raspberry-pi-3-dht22-sensor-influxdb-and-grafana/</guid><description>I recently started looking into ways of monitoring the temperature and humidity in my garage - for two reasons.

I must emphasise that I am not an expert on GDPR, this post is my layman’s conclusion for my specific circumstances. I run this blog as an exercise to help others, provide information and as a hobby.

I will say no more. Another thing I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do (because many people do it far better than me - I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Julian) is do a blow-by-blow account of the keynotes, for me the headlines are that VMware announced VMware Cloud Foundation and Cross Cloud Services.</description></item><item><title>#VMworld 2016 – Day 0, #vmunderground opening acts, #beVCDX</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-day-0-vmunderground-opening-acts-bevcdx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 17:18:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-day-0-vmunderground-opening-acts-bevcdx/</guid><description>I landed in Las Vegas about 9:30PM local time on Saturday evening, having not executed my plan to sleep on the flight! I had planned to sleep on the Toronto to Vegas leg, which would have meant I could head over to the Sips and Stogies pre-event, however a very rowdy hen do a couple of rows away meant that I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep at all, so I grabbed a taxi down to my hotel, the Excalibur, and got myself checked in.</description></item><item><title>#VMworld 2016 – My session picks</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vmworld-2016-my-session-picks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 11:13:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vmworld-2016-my-session-picks/</guid><description>In my post yesterday I promised to post my VMworld session picks, so here it is! I have filled my schedule, and even added some alternate picks when there were too many good sessions to go for. My session picks are focussing around:
vRealize Automation NSX VSAN PowerCLI, APIs and automation Now, before anyone tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve picked too many and I won&amp;rsquo;t make it to all of them - I know!</description></item><item><title>Heading to Las Vegas! #VMworld 2016</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/heading-to-vmworld-us-2016/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 10:24:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/heading-to-vmworld-us-2016/</guid><description>I’ve been very fortunate to be able to go to VMworld Europe for the past 3 years, mainly thanks to the vExpert program and the availability of the blogger pass. This year I knew that I wouldn’t be able to get to Barcelona because of work, so I thought I’d apply for a VMworld US blogger pass - I’m very excited to have been given one! As with previous years, I'll be blogging at least once a day with my thoughts and any useful info I've gleaned - I definitely don't want to take the pass for granted!</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG &amp;ndash; Curry &amp;ndash; Beer &amp;ndash; Sessions &amp;ndash; Weddings</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</guid><description>This was my second UKVMUG and it was my first vCurry evening! so I was really looking forward to getting up to the event and seeing everyone.
The vCurry event was excellent and it was a great chance to enjoy good food in great company. Had the chance to meet with many people I would not normally get the chance to see, Frank @fbuechsel and Brad @VMUG_CEO to name a couple!</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG Ravello Home Lab Winner!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-ravello-home-lab-winner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:11:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-ravello-home-lab-winner/</guid><description>First of all, thank you to everyone who came along to my session at the UKVMUG yesterday, it was great to see so many people at a round table discussion, sorry for those that had to stand! I hope that it was helpful and maybe a few of you will be building some awesome labs in the cloud!
Ravello very kindly sponsored a free home lab, equivalent to the vExpert 1000 hours account as a prize for my session at the UKVMUG yesterday.</description></item><item><title>MindMap: vRealize Automation Roles</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/mindmap-vrealize-automation-roles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:45:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/mindmap-vrealize-automation-roles/</guid><description>I use mind maps quite a lot for study, I find the visual representation of info makes it a lot easier for me to remember!

This morning I woke to the news that I have passed my VCDX-CMA!
This was my second attempt at VCDX and although the first failure was a painful experience, the lessons learned from it were invaluable to take into the defence the second time around. Failing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a negative experience - if there is one thing that I will take from the VCDX program it is that there is ALWAYS more I need to learn, and I can always do better.</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015 – Day 2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-day-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 06:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-day-2/</guid><description>The first full day of VMworld after PEX was a busy one.After the keynote (highlights were the docker announcements) I was on “booth babe” duty at the VMUG lounge. It was great to meet so many folk who were existing VMUG members and leaders as well as prospective new members. If you are at VMworld this year you should definitely stop by!
After lunch I hit the solutions exchange to catch up with a few vendors whom I had a few queries for also took the time to collect the #vExpert hoodie from @simplivity and the #vExpert tile from Tegile (thank you!</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015: Pre-event and Partner Day</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-pre-event-and-partner-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2015 08:36:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-pre-event-and-partner-day/</guid><description>My trip started with a farcical attempt to fly – my 11:50am flight on Sunday didn’t leave ‘til 3:30pm, but in light of William Lam’s travel woes on the same day, I don’t think I’ll complain to heavily. After a quick stop off at the Fira to register and grab my VMworld bag and I headed off to meet DefinIT co-author Simon (@simoneady) at our AirBnB apartment (which, by the way is awesome and a whole load cheaper than a hotel).</description></item><item><title>My #VCDX-CMA defense experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/06/my-vcdx-cma-defense-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 11:31:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/06/my-vcdx-cma-defense-experience/</guid><description>Yesterday, I received the dreaded email
We regret to inform you that your attempt to achieve VCDX certification on June 09-11, 2015 in Frimley, UK was unsuccessful.
It wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely unexpected, but somehow I still hoped my assessment of the defense was pessimistic and so it was nonetheless disappointing. It&amp;rsquo;s a big hit to not achieve something I have been focusing on for months and it is hard not to feel embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the grade.</description></item><item><title>In response to @h0bbel: The "vCommunity"</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/in-response-to-h0bbel-the-vcommunity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2015 07:43:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/in-response-to-h0bbel-the-vcommunity/</guid><description>This is not my normal sort of post - don&amp;rsquo;t worry, normal service will resume shortly.
I read Christian&amp;rsquo;s comments on the vCommunity - or lack of it - yesterday and although some things resonate with me, and a lot of other people, I don&amp;rsquo;t quite agree. I want to be clear this is a response to Christian and not an argument, I respect Christian as someone who does contribute to the vCommunity.</description></item><item><title>Blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani – PernixData</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 15:31:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</guid><description>Recently I had the good fortune to be invited along to a blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani CTO and Co-founder of PernixData.Those of you not in the know Satyam already has quite the track record, more notably for authoring 50+ patents, Principle engineer and Storage CTO for VMware (10 years). So it is safe to say he knows a thing or two about storage and related technology!
Nine of us (bloggers) were in attendance.</description></item><item><title>Book review: Networking for VMware Administrators</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2014 09:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</guid><description>I recently got my hands on a copy* of Chris Wahl and Steve Pantol’s Networking for VMware Administrators and was very keen to read it – especially given the reputation of the authors. I came to the book as someone who is at CCNA level (although now expired) and someone who regularly designs complex VMware networks using standard and distributed switches. I would class myself as having a fairly decent understanding of networking, though not a networking specialist.</description></item></channel></rss>
