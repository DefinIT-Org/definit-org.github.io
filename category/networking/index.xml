&lt;p&gt;It will be no surprise, given &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/the-next-big-thing/"&gt;my impending move to the VMware PSO NSX Practice&lt;/a&gt;, that this morning I&amp;rsquo;ve been focussing on NSX-T. The two sessions I attended were the Introduction to NSX-T Architecture and Integrating NSX-T with Kubernetes. In a weird twist of scheduling, the Kubernetes session was before the introduction session, but it worked out OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the Kubernetes session really enjoyable and really felt like the speakers delivered a great overview of the integration and how they work together. I was pleasantly surprised with how fami&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;liar a lot of the concepts were, coming from an NSX-v and vRealize Automation background. It&amp;rsquo;s similar, but different!

&lt;p&gt;The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic. Then second reason is throughput - each NSX Edge is capable of ~10Gbps throughput, but with ECMP we can have multiple NSX Edges (up to 8) providing 10Gbps each - that&amp;rsquo;s a significant performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deploying F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) in AWS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/deploying-f5-big-ip-virtual-edition-ve-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 10:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/deploying-f5-big-ip-virtual-edition-ve-in-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Recently I was asked to develop some vRealize Orchestrator workflows against the F5 BIG-IP iControl REST API, but I was not able to test freely against a production appliance.

Unfortunately, you need to be running Windows 7 or Server 2008 (or newer) in order to make use of them. Threat Management Gateway 2010 is one option for an SSL VPN endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clients must be Windows 7/Server 2008 or newer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certificate – either commercial or an internal Certificate Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Published CRL – SSTP clients check for the Certificate Revocation List of the CA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you already have an SSL listener (e.g. for Exchange publishing rules) then you need a dedicated IP address for the SSTP connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMG is configured as a “back-firewall” in this environment, with an adaptor in the LAN and one in the Perimeter (DMZ). The DMZ has a NAT relationship to the External public IPs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>In-depth: Installing and Configuring Threat Management Gateway 2010 in a Network Load Balanced Array</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/in-depth-installing-and-configuring-threat-management-gateway-2010-in-a-network-load-balanced-array/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 16:35:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/in-depth-installing-and-configuring-threat-management-gateway-2010-in-a-network-load-balanced-array/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this post I will be installing a TMG Array as a “back firewall” behind a hardware firewall. The Array will consist of two virtual servers, TMG01 and TMG02 which each have 3 NICs. One NIC will be dedicated to the LAN network, accessible internally. One NIC will be dedicated to the DMZ network, accessible to the outside world on a static mapped IP. The third NIC will be a dedicated intra-array communications NIC as per Microsoft’s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Managing ESXi 4.1 with vMA 4.1 on VMware Workstation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/10/managing-esxi-4-1-with-vma-4-1-on-vmware-workstation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2010 21:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/10/managing-esxi-4-1-with-vma-4-1-on-vmware-workstation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;vMA is available as a Virtual Appliance (OVF) from VMware.

Logging on, you’re presented with a shiny command prompt, you can run notepad or regedit…but aside from that, where do you go from there? In the next few series of posts I’ll hopefully point out the basics, and some not so basics!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server configuration tool (sconfig.cmd) is provided in R2 for some of the basic setup tasks, so you can run that by issuing the “sconfig” command.

We have a core switch of 2 Cisco 3750s, connected together for fault tolerance as a single logical switch; we also have several ESX 3.5 hosts with 4 Gigabit Ethernet NICs installed each. The Virtual Machines will all be on VLAN 8 (reserved for internal servers) and the VMKernel will be on VLAN 107 (reserved for VMKernel traffic like VMotion).  I want to create a load balanced, fault tolerant aggregate of these four NICs over the Core Switch.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DCDIAG /TEST:DNS fails with errors regarding root hint servers</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/09/dcdiag-testdns-fails-with-errors-regarding-root-hint-servers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2009 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/09/dcdiag-testdns-fails-with-errors-regarding-root-hint-servers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently resolved an ongoing DNS issue where the Active Directory Integrated DNS was loaded in both the Domain and the DomainDNSZones partition of AD - this is a separate issue and should be resolved differently. My problem when I tried to verify that the fixed DNS setup had propogated around my domain controllers, DC01 and DC02. DC01 kept failing &amp;ldquo;DCDIAG /TEST:DNS&amp;rdquo; with errors regarding the root hint servers. Googling about it was clear that a lot of people were suffering the same issue, but no article I read had correctly identified the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SSH remote console to ESXi server</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/12/ssh-remote-console-to-esxi-server/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2008 13:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/12/ssh-remote-console-to-esxi-server/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently installed an ESXi server, I am getting to grips with the management and administration of it, one of the things that I wanted to be able to do was connect to the remote terminal through SSH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded my SSH client of choice, PuTTY, and set about connecting, however the server refused the connection. It seems that SSH is not enabled out of the box for ESXi and you need to go through some steps to get there - I found some &lt;a href="http://www.yellow-bricks.com/2008/08/10/howto-esxi-and-ssh/"&gt;helpful hints here&lt;/a&gt;.These are the steps that I took, based on the advice and some other research.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Cisco ASA – ASDM “cannot load configuration”</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/11/cisco-asa-asdm-cannot-load-configuration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2008 20:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/11/cisco-asa-asdm-cannot-load-configuration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was configuring our new Cisco ASA 5510 firewall today, as part of a major infrastructure upgrade. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty comfortable with the Cisco IOS, but I still prefer the GUI for the basic set up, using command line to tweak the finer or more complex configurations. However, straight out of the box, I had a very hard time getting the ASDM to load. Being familiar with the PDM from the PIX range of firewalls, I should have guessed the problem straight away. Essentially, whatever problem you&amp;rsquo;re having with the ASDM, whether it&amp;rsquo;s not loading, not reading the configuration or whatever, the answer is likely to be &amp;ldquo;uninstall your current version of Java, google java 1.4.2, install it, try again&amp;rdquo;. It was the same with the PDM, and guess what? It&amp;rsquo;s the same with the ASDM.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
