While we all know that, automating day to day operations tasks is becoming the choice of an IT organization, it is hard for them to find a solution which can completely understand their business policies and provide them the efficiency they need from automating simple operational tasks.
Based on our research, we found that, one of the most time consuming activity done by an Virtual Infrastructure Administrator is to juggle resources between the changing business requirements and ensure that every VM which is being hosted in their environment is BEING SERVED WELL.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2017 – Announcing Part 3 : What’s New with #vROps 6.6</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrops-webinar-2017-announcing-part-3-whats-new-with-vrops-6-6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2017 07:13:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrops-webinar-2017-announcing-part-3-whats-new-with-vrops-6-6/</guid><description>Welcome to the next episode of vRealize Operations Manager Webinar Series.

This time around we will talk about vRealize Operations Manager API. API is your friend if you are trying to automate things which you would normally do on GUI. While GUI is a favourite of most, the geeks prefer the API since that helps them to programatically initiate tasks and go out for a coffee.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series – Part 9 – What’s New with vRealize Operations 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-series-part-9-whats-new-with-vrealize-operations-6-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-series-part-9-whats-new-with-vrealize-operations-6-3/</guid><description>Here is the recording for the episode 9 vRealize Operations Manager Webinar Series 2016.
