The NSX-T docs are…not great, I certainly don’t think you can work out the steps required from the official NCP installation guide without a healthy dollop of background knowledge and familiarity with Kubernetes and CNI.</description></item><item><title>Unable to configure route redistribution with cross-vCenter NSX 6.4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/05/unable-to-configure-route-redistribution-with-cross-vcenter-nsx-6.4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/05/unable-to-configure-route-redistribution-with-cross-vcenter-nsx-6.4/</guid><description>I ran into this UI bug the other day when I was trying to enable route redistribution on an Edge in a Secondary site of a cross-vCenter NSX deployment.
The Edge itself was deployed correctly, and configured to peer with a physical northbound router, however when I attempted to configure the route redistribution I was unable to do so.
Fortunately, the solution was simple - use the API.</description></item><item><title>Lab Notes – vCloud Director 9.1 for Service Providers – Part 1: Pre-requisites</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/02/lab-notes-vcloud-director-9.1-for-service-providers-part-1-pre-requisites/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Feb 2019 17:09:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/02/lab-notes-vcloud-director-9.1-for-service-providers-part-1-pre-requisites/</guid><description>This series was originally going to be a more polished endeavour, but unfortunately time got in the way.

However, I hit a snag when I began to import my existing environment - I couldn’t get the vCenter data collection to run.</description></item><item><title>Three Tier App for vRealize Automation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/03/three-tier-app-for-vrealize-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 10:37:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/03/three-tier-app-for-vrealize-automation/</guid><description>One question I’m asked quite a lot is what I use for a 3-tier application when I’m testing things like NSX micro-segmentation with vRealize Automation. The simple answer is that I used to make something up as I went along, deploying components by hand and generally repeating myself a lot. I had some cut/paste commands in my note application that sped things up a little, but nothing that developed. I’ve been meaning to rectify this for a while, and this is the result!</description></item><item><title>NSX 6.x Network Communications Diagram</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/nsx-6-x-network-communications-diagram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:01:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/nsx-6-x-network-communications-diagram/</guid><description>There are a few NSX Communications network diagrams floating around, but none have really displayed the info in a way I found to be clear or complete enough.

The current integration also enables a method to deploy micro-segmentation out of the box, based on dynamic Security Group membership and the Service Composer. This method does have some limitations, and can be inflexible for the on-going management of deployed applications. It requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of NSX and the Distributed Firewall, as well as access to the Networking and Security manager that is hosted by vCenter Server.</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Upgrading to NSX-T 2.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</guid><description>Yesterday saw the release of NSX-T 2.1, with some new features and also some usability enhancements.

The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2. If follows that I need to upgrade NSX to 6.3 (which supports vSphere 6.0u2) before I can upgrade vSphere to 6.</description></item></channel></rss>
