The NSX-T docs are…not great, I certainly don’t think you can work out the steps required from the official NCP installation guide without a healthy dollop of background knowledge and familiarity with Kubernetes and CNI.</description></item><item><title>Unable to configure route redistribution with cross-vCenter NSX 6.4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/05/unable-to-configure-route-redistribution-with-cross-vcenter-nsx-6.4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/05/unable-to-configure-route-redistribution-with-cross-vcenter-nsx-6.4/</guid><description>I ran into this UI bug the other day when I was trying to enable route redistribution on an Edge in a Secondary site of a cross-vCenter NSX deployment.
The Edge itself was deployed correctly, and configured to peer with a physical northbound router, however when I attempted to configure the route redistribution I was unable to do so.
Fortunately, the solution was simple - use the API.

PKS with NSX-T is a really hot topic right now and I think it’s going to be a big part of the future CNA landscape.
My Lab PKS 1.0.4 deployment is configured as a &amp;ldquo;NO-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) Topology” as depicted in the diagram below (from the PKS documentation).</description></item><item><title>Three Tier App for vRealize Automation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/03/three-tier-app-for-vrealize-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2018 10:37:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/03/three-tier-app-for-vrealize-automation/</guid><description>One question I’m asked quite a lot is what I use for a 3-tier application when I’m testing things like NSX micro-segmentation with vRealize Automation. The simple answer is that I used to make something up as I went along, deploying components by hand and generally repeating myself a lot. I had some cut/paste commands in my note application that sped things up a little, but nothing that developed. I’ve been meaning to rectify this for a while, and this is the result!</description></item><item><title>NSX 6.x Network Communications Diagram</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/nsx-6-x-network-communications-diagram/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 12:01:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/nsx-6-x-network-communications-diagram/</guid><description>There are a few NSX Communications network diagrams floating around, but none have really displayed the info in a way I found to be clear or complete enough. To that end, I have been working on a diagram that covers as much of the communications between NSX Components as I can. I&amp;rsquo;ve currently only covered single site NSX (not Cross vCenter) but I&amp;rsquo;ll publish an updated version soon including that.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 7.3 and NSX – Micro-segmentation strategies</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/vrealize-automation-7-3-and-nsx-micro-segmentation-strategies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2018 17:40:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/vrealize-automation-7-3-and-nsx-micro-segmentation-strategies/</guid><description>vRealize Automation and NSX integration has introduced the ability to deploy multi-tiered applications with network services included. The current integration also enables a method to deploy micro-segmentation out of the box, based on dynamic Security Group membership and the Service Composer. This method does have some limitations, and can be inflexible for the on-going management of deployed applications. It requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of NSX and the Distributed Firewall, as well as access to the Networking and Security manager that is hosted by vCenter Server.</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Upgrading to NSX-T 2.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</guid><description>Yesterday saw the release of NSX-T 2.1, with some new features and also some usability enhancements. You can check out the release notes here https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-21-Release-Notes.html
As I&amp;rsquo;m mid-way through this blog series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d stick in the upgrade as a little bonus!
Download the upgrade bundle Validate the version and status of NSX-T components Check the Controller cluster status and Manager connections are up.
Validate the hosts are installed, and have a connection to the controller and manager.</description></item><item><title>NST-T 2.0 Lab Build: Logical Router Configuration</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nst-t-2-0-lab-build-logical-router-config/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 14:48:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nst-t-2-0-lab-build-logical-router-config/</guid><description>Disclaimer!

TLDR; I&amp;rsquo;m joining VMware as part of the PSO NSX practice!
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression.</description></item><item><title>Lab notes: Upgrading vSphere 6.0 and NSX 6.2 to vSphere 6.5a and NSX 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:07:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding off upgrading my lab to vSphere 6.5 because NSX 6.2.x doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it. With the release of NSX 6.3 and vSphere 6.5a, I can now upgrade.
The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2. If follows that I need to upgrade NSX to 6.3 (which supports vSphere 6.0u2) before I can upgrade vSphere to 6.</description></item></channel></rss>
