This opens the door to all manner of ideas for conditional automation using vROps.

Aside from the obvious addition of cloud costings and comparisons and a reworked capacity planning (from the ground up) and new hook in to Wavefront (which I really like) there has been some real effort to improve how you can further automate things from vROps.</description></item><item><title>#vROps data retention and the Cleaner</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/vrops-data-retention-and-the-cleaner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:36:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/vrops-data-retention-and-the-cleaner/</guid><description>Something that has come up with customers recently is why and when old data is cleaned up from your vROps instance.
I will make the assumption that you have your data retention set to 6 months but the process is the same whether the value is less than or greater than 6 months.
When data reaches and or goes beyond the age threshold set in the global settings it will be cleaned away by a daily process &amp;ldquo;Old Data Cleaner&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2017 – Part 4 : Optimizing Workload Performance Using Automation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/vrops-webinar-2017-part-4-optimizing-workload-performance-using-automation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2017 10:17:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/vrops-webinar-2017-part-4-optimizing-workload-performance-using-automation/</guid><description>In this episode, Sunny gave us a deep dive into the WLP and WLB features of vROps.

While we all know that, automating day to day operations tasks is becoming the choice of an IT organization, it is hard for them to find a solution which can completely understand their business policies and provide them the efficiency they need from automating simple operational tasks.
Based on our research, we found that, one of the most time consuming activity done by an Virtual Infrastructure Administrator is to juggle resources between the changing business requirements and ensure that every VM which is being hosted in their environment is BEING SERVED WELL.</description></item><item><title> #vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 3 – What’s New with vROps 6.6</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-3-whats-new-with-vrops-6-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2017 06:52:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-3-whats-new-with-vrops-6-6/</guid><description>[vRealize Operations Manager 6.6, which was recently released by VMware.

This time around we will talk about the latest release of vROps released in the month of June.
With this release, VMware has made drastic changes to the product and the initial reviews of the product have been great.

Would they need a management pack or is this something vROps can do out of the box?
The short answer to this is yes, but it is not immediately obvious how.
There are a great many metrics that come with a vanilla build of vROps but not all of them are enabled a good example of these are the sensor metrics.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Part 2 – #vROps Webinar series 2017 – “Full Stack” monitoring with vRealize Operations Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/announcing-part-2-vrops-webinar-series-2017-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:50:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/announcing-part-2-vrops-webinar-series-2017-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</guid><description>As promised, vROps Webinar Series 2017 is back with the second episode of the year.

In the past you would either use the sample/examples to get them started and then go and find the specific metric names while, this was usually quite time consuming.
In recent versions of vROps however, VMware have introduced a &amp;ldquo;builder&amp;rdquo; to help you properly format and slect the corect adapters/adapterkinds and metrics.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 1 – What’s New with vROps 6.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:02:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</guid><description>Time to share the recording of the first episode of the vROps Webinar Series 2017.

HA is a great feature and in my opinion should be considered seriously with any deployment (where possible).
Not only does HA protect your Master node (which essentially behaves as an index for your vROps cluster and if lost will render your cluster dead unless you have a working backup of your cluster) it will also allow your cluster to tolerate a data node failure.</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.5 – Two new enhancements/features I really liked</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 08:37:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</guid><description>So vROps 6.5 has been out for around a month now and I finally have a little while to write a post on what I personally really like.

Big thanks to @sunny_dua for doing the session while I was MIA you are a legend buddy!</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 10 : A Deep Dive into vROps API</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-10-a-deep-dive-into-vrops-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Oct 2016 11:57:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-10-a-deep-dive-into-vrops-api/</guid><description>The month has been extremely busy but we still want to continue with the momentum of webinar series getting to the business end of the year. This time around we will talk about vRealize Operations Manager API. API is your friend if you are trying to automate things which you would normally do on GUI. While GUI is a favourite of most, the geeks prefer the API since that helps them to programatically initiate tasks and go out for a coffee.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series – Part 9 – What’s New with vRealize Operations 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-series-part-9-whats-new-with-vrealize-operations-6-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Oct 2016 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-series-part-9-whats-new-with-vrealize-operations-6-3/</guid><description>Here is the recording for the episode 9 vRealize Operations Manager Webinar Series 2016.

This time around, Sunny and I thought about discussing Architecture of vROps. To some, it might sound strange as for smaller deployments you might not have to worry about Sizing and Architecture much since it is pretty simple to install and configure a small or a medium node for a small shop. However as your monitoring needs grow and you start adding solutions for monitoring data sources beyond vSphere, you would need to think about scaling up or scaling out.</description></item><item><title>What if I want full metrics? in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</guid><description>If you have used vCOps (previous version of vROPs) you will likely remember the option in the admin panel where you could change the number of metrics being collected from &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo;.
As many found, this option drop down was not present in vROps and there appeared to be no replacement.
Here is the good news, the ability to collect those metrics has not been removed rather it&amp;rsquo;s just a little more hidden (by design)</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 : Part 4 – Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 08:17:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>As promised, I am posting the recording for the 4th Session of vROps Webinar Series 2016.

However what if you want to scale up your node or nodes, going from say small to medium?
Reasons why?
Perhaps your POC has proved so useful you want to move it into production? You have lots of really useful historical on your existing smaller build and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to redeploy (therefore losing your historical data) You have limitations where scaling out is simply not an option but you need vROps to take on more work.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 4 : Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 11:33:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>We hope you are having fun with the vROps Webinar Series and learning in the process!

The Automation Action Framework (AAF) is one of these, a really powerful vROps in-built automation tool.

Personally I am delighted to get the chance to work with Sunny Duaon this new project. Sunny is a well known and respected Senior Consultant at VMware and can be found often on twitter @Sunny_Dua.</description></item><item><title>vROps multinode SNMP gotcha</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/vrops-multinode-snmp-gotcha/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Nov 2015 20:43:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/vrops-multinode-snmp-gotcha/</guid><description>So if you are already familiar with vROps you will know you can now have multiple nodes in your cluster.
8 nodes if you are on versions 6.0.x 16 nodes if you are on version 6.1 Why does this matter if you plan to use SNMP with your vROps cluster?
Quite simple really, what I discovered today is that even though you have a master node SNMP traps can and will be sent from all of the nodes to the destination you have configured.</description></item><item><title>vROps 6.1 – first glance</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/vrops-6-1-first-glance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2015 15:04:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/vrops-6-1-first-glance/</guid><description>I must admit I have been quite keen to get a look at vROps 6.1 so I was quick to upgrade my lab from 6.0 to 6.1 (with not problems I might add) and have a good look at the new bits and pieces.
The bits I will cover briefly in this post are..
Upgrading from 6.0 EPO functionality Dashboards Automated actions (ON?) Upgrading from 6.0 Ensure you upgrade the OS of the appliance first (if you have one) - vRealize Operations Manager - Virtual Appliance Operating System upgrade (vRealize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-6.</description></item><item><title>vROps 6.1 whats new?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/vrops-6-1-whats-new/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2015 21:12:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/vrops-6-1-whats-new/</guid><description>So vROps 6.1 has gone GA!
What have the guys at VMware added? I have listed what I consider the hi-lights below
The maximum of 8 nodes has been doubled to 16!
SSO integration has been added (requires vSphere 6.0)
**Support for SRM has been added
**
         vRealize Hyperic functionality has been added</description></item><item><title>The vROps HA conundrum</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/the-vrops-ha-conundrum/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2015 14:54:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/the-vrops-ha-conundrum/</guid><description>One of the great new features included in vROps is High Availability, however when you look a little closer at how it works careful thought needs to go into whether you want to use it or not.
I have had several discussions with my colleagues on the subject about whether you should or should not enable it in any given deployment of a vROps cluster.
So the following are my thoughts and bullet points for you to consider when faced with same dilemma.</description></item><item><title>VCE Vision, vCOPs to vROps migration</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/vce-vision-vcops-to-vrops-migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 22:26:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/vce-vision-vcops-to-vrops-migration/</guid><description>Recently I have been working with various products that compliment or are accessed by vCOPs/vROps via Management packs.
As vROps is still fairly new in comparative terms to other products like vCOPs and VCE Vision, when planning migrations from vCOPs to vROps it is naturally important to check compatibility and what is required for a successful migration.
If you are doing a greenfield deployment of vROps there is nothing to be concerned about, you simply need the VCE Vision appliance running version 2.</description></item><item><title>Automate the deployment of vROps (supporting vDS)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/05/automate-the-deployment-of-vrops-supporting-vds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 12:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/05/automate-the-deployment-of-vrops-supporting-vds/</guid><description>Recently I have been looking at William Lam&amp;rsquo;s excellent post on automating the deployment of vROps.
After having a play around with it, to suit my own needs, I made some modifications to the Powershell script so it would support distributed switches.

So what is it like out of the box?
vROps 6.0 Release notes
The first clear change is the move away from 2 VMs in a vAPP and consolidation down to 1 VM which is then easily scalable to more as you require.</description></item><item><title>vCOPs resources (vCenter Operations Manager)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/12/vcops-resources-vcenter-operations-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Dec 2014 12:57:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/12/vcops-resources-vcenter-operations-manager/</guid><description>vCOPs resources If you have spent time working with vCOPs you will be aware of the numerous and widespread resources out on the net to help you install and fine tune your deployment. Given there is a lot of content out there that is not always easy to fine immediately I wanted to collate a useful list for my own use and to share with others.
Still a work in progress.</description></item><item><title>Slow or failed logon to VCSA 5.5 with vCOps in the environment</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/07/slow-or-failed-logon-to-vcsa-5-5-with-vcops-in-the-environment/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 09:15:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/07/slow-or-failed-logon-to-vcsa-5-5-with-vcops-in-the-environment/</guid><description>Recently I encountered this problem in a customer site whereby the logon to VCSA 5.5 would either time out, or take 3-5 minutes to actually log on.
Running a netstat on the VCSA during the attempt to logon showed there was a SYN packet sent to the vCOps appliance on port 443 that never established a connection. Another check was attempting to connect using curl &amp;lt;https://&amp;gt; –k - this would time out.</description></item><item><title>Installing and configuring VMware Infrastructure Navigator 5.8</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/installing-and-configuring-vmware-infrastructure-navigator-5-8/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2014 10:40:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/installing-and-configuring-vmware-infrastructure-navigator-5-8/</guid><description>According to VMware, Infrastructure Navigator is
…a component of the VMware vCenter Operations Management Suite. It automatically discovers application services, visualizes relationships and maps dependencies of applications on virtualized compute, storage and network resources.
Effectively it takes a look at the network connections that are running between your VMs (and physical servers) and works out which applications and services are running on each, and the dependencies – both upstream and downstream – for each VM.</description></item><item><title>Installing vCOps 5.8 in the DefinIT Lab &amp;ndash; 4GB RAM and 2 vCPU</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/installing-vcops-5-8-in-the-definit-lab-4gb-ram-and-2-vcpu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 11:38:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/installing-vcops-5-8-in-the-definit-lab-4gb-ram-and-2-vcpu/</guid><description>There’s no doubt that vCOps is a great product for proactively monitoring your vSphere environment, but it’s a hefty package for the lab. The minimum recommended RAM is a whopping 16GB – in my lab that’s the whole of my management host! I recently needed to do some testing so I wanted to get it running in the lab with the barest minimum I could get working, and it turns out you can get working with just 4GB and 2 CPU…albeit you wouldn’t want to monitor much!</description></item></channel></rss>
