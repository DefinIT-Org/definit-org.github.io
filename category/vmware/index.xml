Another of the packaged applications available is Fluent-bit, which enables log forwarding from your Kubernetes cluster and workloads to a range of supported logging endpoints.
There are a couple of tweaks required in order to forward logs to vRealize Automation Log Insight Cloud. We need to use the HTTP output in the Fluent Bit configuration to forward the logs as a JSON payload to the Log Insight API.</description></item><item><title>Ingress, SSL and DNS using TKG 1.4 Packages on TKGs Clusters</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve set up your shiny new Workload Management on vSphere, created a Namespace and deployed a cluster&amp;hellip;now what?! When you deploy a workload cluster from Workload Management on vSphere 7, it comes with basic functionality, but in order to start running workloads you will inevitably need to install additional tools. That&amp;rsquo;s where Tanzu&amp;rsquo;s Packages come into play.

For the most part, I try and keep my applications and configurations stateless - relying on ConfigMaps for example to store application configuration. This means with a handful of YAML files in my Git repository I can restore everything to working order. Sometimes though, there&amp;rsquo;s no choice but to use a PersistentVolume to provide some data persistance where you can&amp;rsquo;t capture it in a config file.</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2020 and VMware {Code} Connect!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/09/vmworld-2020-and-vmware-code-connect/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/09/vmworld-2020-and-vmware-code-connect/</guid><description>Where can you find me at VMworld 2020 VMworld 2020 - possible together VMworld 2020 is fast approaching (Sept 29th-October 1st), and in case you hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard, it online and free!

The diagram below shows the architecture of the solution.
Deploying vCHA can be done in two modes - &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;. You can use Basic mode if the vCenter you want to be HA is managing the hosts it resides on - in this scenario the wizard configures your vCenter and deploys the Passive and Witness nodes for you.</description></item><item><title>Alexa, turn on my workload cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 15:05:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</guid><description>I already have a vRealize Orchestrator workflow to shutdown my workload cluster.

The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator Workflow: shutdownVSANCluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</guid><description>My vSphere lab is split into two halves - a low power management cluster, powered by 3 Intel NUCs, and a more hefty workload cluster powered by a Dell C6100 chassis with 3 nodes. The workload servers are noisy and power hungry so they tend to be powered off when I am not using them, and since they live in my garage, I power them on and off remotely.
To automate the process, I wanted to write an Orchestrator workflow (vRO sits on my management cluster and is therefore always on) that could safely and robustly shut down the workload cluster.</description></item><item><title>Increasing the Java Heap size for vRealize Orchestrator Client (7.x)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/increasing-the-java-heap-size-for-vrealize-orchestrator-client-7-x/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2016 11:05:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/increasing-the-java-heap-size-for-vrealize-orchestrator-client-7-x/</guid><description>Back in January 2015 I wrote an article on how to modify the Java heap settings for the vCenter Orchestrator client when working with very large workflows.

Note that none of this is official or supported by VMware as far as I know - it&amp;rsquo;s the results of my experimentation which has shown some performance improvement by increasing the configured memory pool.</description></item><item><title>Deploying to AWS with Software Components on vRealize Automation 7</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/deploying-to-aws-with-software-components-on-vrealize-automation-7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 17:09:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/deploying-to-aws-with-software-components-on-vrealize-automation-7/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some ideas in my lab to leverage the AWS endpoint on vRealize Automation.

I think the problem occurred because the IP addresses were all changed and the VMs shut down, without time for the application to update the node IPs.
The symptoms:
The web interface was down, a netstat -ano | grep -i “443” showed the service was listening _service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes /var/log/loginsight/runtime.</description></item><item><title>Adding a vCloud Air (PAYG/Gen2) instance to vRealize Orchestrator as a vCloud Director host</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/adding-a-vcloud-air-payggen2-instance-to-vrealize-orchestrator-as-a-vcloud-director-host/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2016 13:26:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/adding-a-vcloud-air-payggen2-instance-to-vrealize-orchestrator-as-a-vcloud-director-host/</guid><description>Big thanks to Jose Luis Gomez for this solution, his response to my tweet was spot on and invaluable!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to configure vCloud Air as a vCloud Director host in vRealize Orchestrator in order to create some custom resource actions for Day 2 operations in vRealize Automation. What I found was that there&amp;rsquo;s *very* little information out there on how to do this, and I ended up writing my own custom resource mapping for the virtual machines to VCAC:VirtualMachine objects - at least that way I could add my resource action.</description></item><item><title>What’s in my vRA7 EBS Payloads?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/whats-in-my-vra7-ebs-payloads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 15:52:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/whats-in-my-vra7-ebs-payloads/</guid><description>&amp;lt;img class=&amp;ldquo;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6186&amp;rdquo; src=&amp;quot;/images/2015/07/vRA-Product-Icon-Mac_0.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;vRA&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; - a properties object.

At this point it time you can still use the old method of using workflow stubs to customise machine lifecycle events, but at some point in the future this will be deprecated and the Event Broker will be the only way to extend.
With this in mind, I wanted to use the Event Broker to do something that I am asked on almost every customer engagement - custom hostnames beyond what the Machine Prefixes mechanism can do.</description></item><item><title>Can I secure #vROps?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/can-i-secure-vrops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 13:42:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/can-i-secure-vrops/</guid><description>Those of you used to using vSphere on a regular basis will already be aware of the hardening guide for ESXi and vSphere but what about vROps?

What has become a consistent theme in all the stories is just how much compute resources vROps requires when you “go big” and not just what is clearly defined in the sizing spreadsheet.
For example some of the large deployments I have either been involved in or heard about (to monitor upwards and beyond of 30000 VMs) required the deployment of Large vROps nodes.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Operations Webinar Series : 2015 :Part 1 : Building Self Healing Environments with #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrealize-operations-webinar-series-2015-part-1-building-self-healing-environments-with-vrops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2016 10:20:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrealize-operations-webinar-series-2015-part-1-building-self-healing-environments-with-vrops/</guid><description>A series of webcasts on vRealize Operations Manager 6.x, helping you learn about anything and everything about the solution.

This was my second attempt at VCDX and although the first failure was a painful experience, the lessons learned from it were invaluable to take into the defence the second time around.

What I didn’t want to do was simply edit the connections directly – quite often with the VMware appliances there are scripts on start-up to ensure the configuration is correct and consistent – what I wanted was to be able to find a more supported and reliable way.</description></item><item><title>Resetting the vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller root password</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 13:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how supported this is, but this process can recover a vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller when you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the root password.
Download the OpenSUSE Rescue CD - http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/13.2/iso/
Mount the CD to the PSC Appliance
Reboot the appliance and enter the BIOS setup using F2, configure the CD-ROM as first-boot device. Save and exit to reboot into the SUSE Live-CD.
Once the Live-CD has booted to a desktop, you’ll see a 12GB volume at the top – that’s your PSC appliance root.</description></item><item><title>Deploying vRealize Automation 6.2 Appliance Cluster with Postgres Replication</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/deploying-vrealize-automation-6-2-appliance-cluster-with-postgres-replication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 19:57:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/deploying-vrealize-automation-6-2-appliance-cluster-with-postgres-replication/</guid><description>The recommendations for the vRealize Appliance have changed with 6.2, the published reference architecture now does not recommend using an external Postgres database (either vPostgres appliance, a 3rd party Postgres deployment or using a third vRealize Appliance as a stand-alone database installation).

With the VMware vCenter Orchestrator Multi-Node Plug-In, administrators have a more efficient way to manage multiple Orchestrator instances from a central point.

If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates.

I&amp;rsquo;m staying in a hotel that is actually quite far from the conference, it&amp;rsquo;s a metro, train and bus journey away from the conference center and it takes about 40 minutes to get here. On the plus side I was only 5 minutes away from the VMUG party last night so I went over there for an hour or so.</description></item><item><title>VMware – The future of IT Google Hangout</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vmware-the-future-of-it-google-hangout/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2013 12:16:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vmware-the-future-of-it-google-hangout/</guid><description>Recently I had the privilege to be asked to attend a Google hangout with Joe Baguley (VMware CTO EMEA), Paul Saffo (Technology Forecaster) and several other well known guys from the VMUG community VMware - The future of IT Google Hangout

I have to rotate the password of all hosts once a month for compliance, but sometimes a host drops out of the loop and the root password gets lost. Fortunately, as the vpxuser is still valid I can manage the host via vCenter - this lends itself to this little recovery process:</description></item><item><title>vSphere Security: Active Directory Authentication</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vsphere-security-active-directory-authentication/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2013 15:13:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vsphere-security-active-directory-authentication/</guid><description>This is the second article in a series of vSphere Security articles that I have planned.

Why would you want to join an ESXi host to an Active Directory domain?

I think lockdown mode is a feature that is rarely understood, and even more rarely used. Researching this article I’ve already encountered several different definitions that weren’t quite right.

This strikes me as odd when the default for a standard switch is 120.
You can see in the screenshot below that when I create a Virtual Switch without the parameter, it creates it with 64 ports. Once you minus the 8 reserved for physical NIC ports (uplinks), CDP traffic, and network discovery it leaves you with 56 ports available for VMs.</description></item><item><title>Using the vExpert.me URL shortener and WordPress</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/using-the-vexpert-me-url-shortener-and-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2013 15:30:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/using-the-vexpert-me-url-shortener-and-wordpress/</guid><description>One of the many perks of being a vExpert is the cool vexpert.me URL shortener provided by Darren Woollard (@dawoo).

Why does it require multiple certificates for my vCenter server? In short, each service requires a certificate because it could feasibly be on a server (or servers) of it&amp;rsquo;s own - take this hypothetical design - each role is hosted on it&amp;rsquo;s own VM, and there are 7 certificates required - SSO, Inventory Service, vCenter Server, Orchestrator, Web Client, Log Browser and Update Manager.</description></item><item><title>Updating ESXi Fibre Channel HBA Drivers via VMware Update Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 14:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</guid><description>A problem reared it&amp;rsquo;s head over the weekend with one of our hosts&amp;rsquo; Fibre Channel HBAs negotiating it&amp;rsquo;s way down to 2GB, and consequently introducing massive latency for the LUNs behind it.
