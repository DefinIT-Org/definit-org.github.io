However, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been conscious that running a lab on old hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly have much in the way of green credentials. So, in an effort to reduce my carbon footprint (and electricity bill) I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for ways to shut down my lab when it&amp;rsquo;s not in use.</description></item><item><title>Using GitLab Pipelines to deploy Hugo sites to AWS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/using-gitlab-pipelines-to-deploy-hugo-sites-to-aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/using-gitlab-pipelines-to-deploy-hugo-sites-to-aws/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted previously about moving to Hugo as a publishing platform for this blog, this post is a bit more about how I&amp;rsquo;m managing the publishing using GitLab&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD Pipelines.
Firstly, I need to mention that I&amp;rsquo;m using three different repositories for my code base, and why. The three repositories are:
definit-hugo - this contains the hugo site configuration definit-content - this contains the site content - markdown files, images etc definit-theme - this contains the VMware Clarity-based theme I use for my site definit-content and definit-theme are git submodules in the definit-hugo project, mapped into the /content and /themes folders respectively.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring temperature and humidity with a Raspberry Pi 3, DHT22 sensor, InfluxDB and Grafana</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/07/monitoring-temperature-and-humidity-with-a-raspberry-pi-3-dht22-sensor-influxdb-and-grafana/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:52:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/07/monitoring-temperature-and-humidity-with-a-raspberry-pi-3-dht22-sensor-influxdb-and-grafana/</guid><description>I recently started looking into ways of monitoring the temperature and humidity in my garage - for two reasons. Firstly, I have my lab workload cluster out there in the form of a Dell C6100, and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed with the recent weather that the temperature in there getsâ€¦a bit warm. Secondly, I like to brew beer at home, and one of the keys to a good brew is consistent temperature!</description></item></channel></rss>
