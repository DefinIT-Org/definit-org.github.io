Today, amidst all of the noise from VMWorld, PowerCLI Core dropped as a Fling! That means that although it&amp;rsquo;s not ready for production use yet, it is ready to start testing - and I&amp;rsquo;m way more excited than I should be!</description></item><item><title>VCAC 6.0 build-out to distributed model &amp;ndash; Part 1: Certificates</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vcac-6-0-build-out-to-distributed-model-part-1-certificates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 11:43:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vcac-6-0-build-out-to-distributed-model-part-1-certificates/</guid><description>This is the first article in a series about how to build-out a simple vCAC 6 installation to a distributed model.
Simple vCAC deployment In a simple installation you have the Identity Appliance, the vCAC appliance (which includes a vPostgres DB and vCenter Orchestrator instance) and an IaaS server. The distributed model still has a single Identity Appliance but clusters 2 or more vCAC appliances behind a load balancer, backed by a separate vPostgres database appliance.</description></item><item><title>Generating and Installing CA Signed Certificates for VMware SRM 5.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/generating-and-installing-ca-signed-certificates-for-vmware-srm-5-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 10:11:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/generating-and-installing-ca-signed-certificates-for-vmware-srm-5-5/</guid><description>I‚Äôm fairly new to SRM, but even so this one seemed like a real head-scratcher!

Get the NICs right first In this case I came to a project after the initial installation of the array and there was no dedicated intra-array network installed.

In site editing mode, all the drop down menus would appear for a flash and then go blank. The actual admin pages we were trying to get to would work if you entered them into the browser directly, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy way to manage the site!
The problem turned out to be that in the process of getting the 3rd party web parts to work, the support team had added a MIME type to the IIS installation.</description></item><item><title>Adding a Windows 2003 domain controller to your existing Windows 2000 domain</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/adding-a-windows-2003-domain-controller-to-your-existing-windows-2000-domain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2008 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/adding-a-windows-2003-domain-controller-to-your-existing-windows-2000-domain/</guid><description>I was adding a shiny new domain controller to my server farm earlier today, we have just two Windows 2000 SP4 domain controllers on old kit and they&amp;nbsp;are due to retire. With the hardware selected, purchased&amp;nbsp;and a fresh copy of Windows Server 2003 R2 installed, I set to installing Active Directory. DCPromo.exe fires up and I go through the configuration steps until&amp;#8230; "The Active Directory Installation Wizard cannot continue because the forest is not prepared for installing Windows Server 2003.</description></item><item><title>Restoring the ASP.NET tab in IIS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/restoring-the-asp-net-tab-in-iis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2008 18:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/restoring-the-asp-net-tab-in-iis/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve logged onto the properties for your IIS install and found that the ASP.NET tab has mysteriously disappered, you can try a couple of things.
Firstly, try re-registering ASP.NET with IIS using the ASPNET_REGIIS.exe located in the .NET installation folder:
c:\WINDOWS\MICROSOFT.NET\framework\\aspnet_regiis -i &amp;nbsp; Chances are though, that it won't work, and that you can try and number of command using aspnet_regiis.exe or even uninstalling and reinstalling .NET and you won't actually fix the problem.</description></item><item><title>Installing Windows XP without a CD drive</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/03/installing-windows-xp-without-a-cd-drive/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2008 21:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/03/installing-windows-xp-without-a-cd-drive/</guid><description>When the Dell engineer¬†said ‚Äúthey‚Äôve asked if you can reinstall the OS‚Äù my heart sank. Not because I felt like he was weasling out of work - unusually they were very helpful. Not because installing XP is a hard task, I‚Äôve done it over 100 times on all sorts of hardware.
No, the reason I let out a sigh was because this particular laptop, the Latitude X1, has no internal CD/DVD drive.</description></item><item><title>Retrieving Your Exchange Server 2003 License Key</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/02/retrieving-your-exchange-server-2003-license-key/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2008 21:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/02/retrieving-your-exchange-server-2003-license-key/</guid><description>Recently I found the need to retrieve the key from an existing Exchange Server for a reinstall - the software is legally licensed but the key was somehow lost. A trawl through my registry revealed that the key is stored in an obscure place:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Integration\{GUID}\PID3.0 This was the case on a Windows Server 2000 install with Exchange Server 2003 installed, when I get the chance I will test this on Server 2003.</description></item><item><title>Using NTDSUtil to transfer FSMO Roles by command line</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/01/using-ntdsutil-to-transfer-fsmo-roles-by-command-line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2008 20:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/01/using-ntdsutil-to-transfer-fsmo-roles-by-command-line/</guid><description>I‚Äôve just removed a domain controller (DC) from my root domain, the very first server not only in the domain, but the forest. The roles were migrating to a newer server, far more up to the job, but it isn‚Äôt a job to be taken lightly. If you mess up the root domain, you‚Äôve potentially got problems all the way down your domain hierarchy.
&amp;nbsp; Let me explain; the primary domain controller in a domain (normally the first domain controller) hosts all the FSMO roles.</description></item><item><title>Visual Studio Project Location Not Trusted</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/visual-studio-project-location-not-trusted/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2007 19:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/visual-studio-project-location-not-trusted/</guid><description>Just a quick post today about trust levels for .NET assemblies that are hosted remotely. My current set up at work means that I am maintaining one version of our web site while working on developing a new one - not uncommon. I have 2 virtual servers running Server 2003, IIS and SQL Server, each an identical copy of our production server. Each solution and it&amp;rsquo;s projects are stored on each virtual server, with the project folders shared and mapped as drives on my laptop.</description></item><item><title>Office 2007 woes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/05/office-2007-woes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 20:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/05/office-2007-woes/</guid><description>Originally published Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 Wahey!

Here‚Äôs what I wrote: ‚ÄúNew software always excites me, so I was enthusiastic as I installed Office 2007 on my laptop.
