PowerShell for macOS has been available for a while now, but what a lot of PowerCLI fans have been waiting for is to be able to use PowerCLI direct from their Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, amidst all of the noise from VMWorld, PowerCLI Core dropped as a Fling! That means that although it&amp;rsquo;s not ready for production use yet, it is ready to start testing - and I&amp;rsquo;m way more excited than I should be!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCAC 6.0 build-out to distributed model &amp;ndash; Part 1: Certificates</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vcac-6-0-build-out-to-distributed-model-part-1-certificates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 11:43:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vcac-6-0-build-out-to-distributed-model-part-1-certificates/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;This is the first article in a series about how to build-out a simple vCAC 6 installation to a distributed model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a simple installation you have the Identity Appliance, the vCAC appliance (which includes a vPostgres DB and vCenter Orchestrator instance) and an IaaS server. The distributed model still has a single Identity Appliance but clusters 2 or more vCAC appliances behind a load balancer, backed by a separate vPostgres database appliance. The IaaS components are installed on 2 or more IaaS Windows servers and are load balanced, backed by an external MSSQL database. Additionally, the vCenter Orchestrator appliance is used in a failover cluster, backed by the external vPostgres database appliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Generating and Installing CA Signed Certificates for VMware SRM 5.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/generating-and-installing-ca-signed-certificates-for-vmware-srm-5-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 10:11:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/generating-and-installing-ca-signed-certificates-for-vmware-srm-5-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I’m fairly new to SRM, but even so this one seemed like a real head-scratcher! If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SRM Authentication&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). Where the process fails is during the “configure connection” stage, if either one of your vCenter servers does not have CA signed and the other does (throws an error that they are using different authentication methods) or that you are using self-signed certificates for either SRM installation (throws an error that the certificate or CA could not be trusted).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerCLI Script to set RDM LUNs to Perennially Reserved – Fixes Slow Boot of ESXi 5.1 with MSCS RDMs</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/03/powercli-script-to-set-rdm-luns-to-perennially-reserved-fixes-slow-boot-of-esxi-5-1-with-mscs-rdms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 14:02:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/03/powercli-script-to-set-rdm-luns-to-perennially-reserved-fixes-slow-boot-of-esxi-5-1-with-mscs-rdms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/Ppl7Hl"&gt;posted around this topic&lt;/a&gt; as part of another problem but having had to figure out the process again I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth re-posting a proper script for this. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;VMware KB 1016106 &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;is snappily titled &amp;ldquo;ESXi/ESX hosts with visibility to RDM LUNs being used by MSCS nodes with RDMs may take a long time to boot or during LUN rescan&amp;rdquo; and describes the situation where booting ESXi (5.1 in my case) takes a huge amount of time to boot because it&amp;rsquo;s attempting to gain a SCSI reservation on an RDM disk used by MS Clustering Services.

It&amp;rsquo;s more than a little motivated by some friendly competition with a Microsoft PFE for SCOM, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll agree it&amp;rsquo;s a big improvement on the last version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updated for this version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatting changed to make it more readable and more compatible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &amp;ldquo;Report generated on &lt;em&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; to the top of the report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management Server states reported as one section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default MP check moved to beneath the Management servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agents in pending states moved to be with the Agent health states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified &amp;ldquo;Unresponsive Agents&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Agents reporting errors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management server alerts streamlined&lt;/li&gt;

Based on this Microsoft recommend a series of health checks to for the environment that should be carried out every day. This is summarised as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the health of all Management Servers and Gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the RMS is not in maintenance mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Outstanding Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Agent&amp;rsquo;s Health Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Backup Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review any Management Group Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the Pending Management status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Database Sizes (Operations, Data warehouse, ACS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Volume of Alerts&lt;/li&gt;

It’s available to download here: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx" title="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install the MSI on both ends – for the sake of this, say SERVER1 and SERVER2. Once you’ve installed it on the server, navigate to \Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\NT Testing TCP Tool, you should see a few copies of the tool for different architectures. Locate the correct .exe for you architecture and rename it to ntttcps.exe.

&lt;p&gt;Uninstall the update package from the Programs and Features control panel&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are using Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you have a Microsoft Certificate Services 2003 Certificate Authority on your domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you have non-domain Windows Server 2008 servers you wish to monitor or set up as a gateway server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a certificate for either a Gateway Server or remotely monitored Server can be a touch vexing. If you’re installing on the same domain as the SCOM management server the security settings take care of themselves, not so for non-domain servers, which require mutual certificate authentication. The Gateway must trust the Domain CA and identify itself as trusted to the Management Server. I have bashed my head against this several times now, so I thought I’d make a precise blog post to cover the steps required!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 “New Local Move Request” and “New Remote Move Request” missing when you right-click a user’s MailBox</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/exchange-2010-%E2%80%9Cnew-local-move-request%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cnew-remote-move-request%E2%80%9D-missing-when-you-right-click-a-user%E2%80%99s-mailbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 12:14:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/exchange-2010-%E2%80%9Cnew-local-move-request%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cnew-remote-move-request%E2%80%9D-missing-when-you-right-click-a-user%E2%80%99s-mailbox/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently testing an Exchange 2010 server for the organisation prior to a migration project, specifically testing moving mailboxes backwards and forwards.

My problem when I tried to verify that the fixed DNS setup had propogated around my domain controllers, DC01 and DC02. DC01 kept failing &amp;ldquo;DCDIAG /TEST:DNS&amp;rdquo; with errors regarding the root hint servers. Googling about it was clear that a lot of people were suffering the same issue, but no article I read had correctly identified the solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using AC97 audio with Windows 7</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/07/using-ac97-audio-with-windows-7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2009 08:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/07/using-ac97-audio-with-windows-7/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Like thousands of other IT pros out there, I&amp;rsquo;m testing Windows 7 out on my laptop - since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mess around with my main PC, it&amp;rsquo;s running on some older kit.

Unfortunately this policy was accidently linked to the root of our domain too, causing our Domain Admin users to be redirected too - something we do not want. When the mistake was discovered, the policy was unlinked, but the redirection remained (despite being set to revert when users fall out of scope). I tried re-applying the policy, modifying the out of scope policy and then moving the Domain Admin user out of scope, but it failed to remove the folder redirection.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Windows update or installer fails to install with error “You do not have permission to update Windows Server 2003.
