UMDS is tool you can install to download patches (and third party VIBs - I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that) for Update Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for environments that don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or air-gapped, and also for environments with multiple vCenter Servers where you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to download the same patch on every server. You can control which patches you download (for example, limiting to ESXi 6.7+ only) and you can add third party Vendor repositories (e.g. Dell or HPE).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Enable vCenter High Availability with vRealize Orchestrator</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/09/enable-vcenter-high-availability-with-vrealize-orchestrator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2018 11:45:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/09/enable-vcenter-high-availability-with-vrealize-orchestrator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick post today to cover a new vRO action and workflow I’ve uploaded to GitHub that configures vCenter High Availability in the basic mode. This is based on &lt;a href="https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2016/12/vcenter-server-high-availability-vcha-powercli-6-5-community-module.html"&gt;William Lam’s excellent PowerShell module&lt;/a&gt; that does the same, but using vRO. I also hope to release a version for the advanced mode based on my &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/06/powershell-deploying-vcenter-high-availability-in-advanced-mode/"&gt;PowerShell script&lt;/a&gt; in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workflow itself is pretty self explanatory, with my deployment action, which returns a VC:Task, and the standard “wait for a task to end” action.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NST-T 2.0 Lab Build: Logical Router Configuration</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nst-t-2-0-lab-build-logical-router-config/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 14:48:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nst-t-2-0-lab-build-logical-router-config/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer!

The diagram below shows the architecture of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying vCHA can be done in two modes - &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;. You can use Basic mode if the vCenter you want to be HA is managing the hosts it resides on - in this scenario the wizard configures your vCenter and deploys the Passive and Witness nodes for you. If you have a management cluster for your vCenter Server, or you are deploying a nested environment, you need to use the advanced mode - in this scenario you must configure your active node, deploy clones for the passive and witness nodes, then enable the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lab notes: Upgrading vSphere 6.0 and NSX 6.2 to vSphere 6.5a and NSX 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:07:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding off upgrading my lab to vSphere 6.5  because NSX 6.2.x doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it.

&lt;p&gt;The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

&lt;p&gt;The first solution is to modify the password expiration policy for SSO. I’m not advocating this necessarily – I think that expiring passwords ensure that you change them regularly and increase the overall security of your SSO solution. However, I can envisage situations (similar to mine) when the SSO administrator account is not used for a long time and expired – that causes headaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SSO Admin password reset with ssopass – SslHandshakeFailed – vSphere 5.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/11/sso-admin-password-reset-with-ssopass-sslhandshakefailed-vsphere-5-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 12:53:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/11/sso-admin-password-reset-with-ssopass-sslhandshakefailed-vsphere-5-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Today I found out that in vSphere 5.1 the SSO administrator account (admin@system-domain) has a password that expires after 365 days.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In vSphere 5.5 it gets even better – the password expires every 90 days by default!

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours online with VMware support I took a guess at the problem. On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain. The SSO admin account (admin@System-Domain) is a part of that domain and so my guess is that the installer tries to authenticate using &lt;a href="mailto:admin@definit.local"&gt;admin@definit.local&lt;/a&gt; rather than System-Domain, which of course failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCP5 – vSphere 5 Configuration Maximums Quiz in PowerShell</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 16:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/02/powershell.png" alt=""&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning my vSphere 5 config maximums before my upcoming VCP5 exam, so in a supreme effort of procrastination I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a PowerShell quiz script: here it is!&lt;/p&gt;

In other words, from &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/09/vcenter-single-sign-on-part-1-what-is-vcenter-single-sign-on.html"&gt;VMware&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multisite deployments are  where a local replica is maintained at remote sites of the primary vCenter Single Sign-On instance. vCenter Servers are reconfigured to use the local vCenter Single Sign-On service and reduce authentication requests across the WAN. Multisite deployments do drop the support of single pane of glass views unless Linked Mode is utilized and multisite deployments are actually required to maintain Linked Mode configurations where roles, permissions and licenses are replicated between linked vCenter servers. Linked mode will re-enable single pane of glass views across multisite instances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Host disk write latency errors – troubleshooting</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2012 11:02:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;So recently we upgraded our cluster monitoring suite to it&amp;rsquo;s latest iteration (Veeam ONE), it was not long before I began to receive emails from the monitor informing me of Host disk write latency &amp;ldquo;errors&amp;rdquo; (Datastore write latency had exceeded the defined threshold in the monitor) on several of the Datastores on our SAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I began the process of cross referencing backup routines and any heavy I/O routines that may have been running at the time the warning messages were generated. My conclusion was that even under average load these alerts were being generated, which was far from ideal even if we had not noticed any performance problems with any of the busy VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vCenter 5.1 – Configuring vCenter Linked Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/vcenter-5-1-configuring-vcenter-linked-mode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2012 15:42:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/vcenter-5-1-configuring-vcenter-linked-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;One thing we have been meaning to do for a while but haven&amp;rsquo;t got round to is getting our Virtual Center Servers into &amp;ldquo;Linked&amp;rdquo; mode - essentially to provide a single pane of glass view of our entire virtual estate.

The &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; are organised into categories to &amp;ldquo;define how the tags can be applied to inventory objects&amp;rdquo;. The easiest way to think of the difference is that custom attributes are &amp;ldquo;free text&amp;rdquo; and the tags are statically defined properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wizard for converting custom attributes to tags, but it can get a bit confusing and is pretty poor - let me explain. We use four custom attributes in my current environment: CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Owner and ServiceType. CreatedBy contains the user ID of the person who created the VM, CreatedOn is the timestamp of when the VM was created, Owner is the Business Unit who own the server and ServiceType is the type of service - e.g. Active Directory, or SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere HA agent for host [Host’s Name] has an error in [Cluster’s Name] in [Datacenter’s Name]: vSphere HA agent cannot be correctly installed or configured</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/vsphere-ha-agent-for-host-hosts-name-has-an-error-in-clusters-name-in-datacenters-name-vsphere-ha-agent-cannot-be-correctly-installed-or-configured/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2012 10:23:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/vsphere-ha-agent-for-host-hosts-name-has-an-error-in-clusters-name-in-datacenters-name-vsphere-ha-agent-cannot-be-correctly-installed-or-configured/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a lesson in checking the basics!

Except you can’t, the feature is no-where to be seen. Something to bear in mind though, your OS needs to support hot-add, so you’ll need a Windows Enterprise or Datacenter edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to enable it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade the VM’s tools, if you haven’t already. This requires a re-boot, but don’t reboot, shut the server down down, otherwise you’ll require another reboot to add the feature. The tools can be upgraded from the system tray icon.&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/image_thumb_27.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Migrating VMware Virtual Infrastructure 3 HA Cluster to vSphere 4 – Stage 1: vCenter Upgrade</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/11/migrating-vmware-virtual-infrastructure-3-ha-cluster-to-vsphere-4-%E2%80%93-stage-1-vcenter-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2009 17:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/11/migrating-vmware-virtual-infrastructure-3-ha-cluster-to-vsphere-4-%E2%80%93-stage-1-vcenter-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of migrating a 2-host High Availability cluster of ESX 3.5u4 servers to vSphere 4.
