&lt;p&gt;I looked back and realised the last time I posted here was July 2022—almost three years ago! It’s hard to believe how quickly that time has flown. Consider this post a signal of intent: I’m planning to start publishing content here once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="so-why-did-i-stop"&gt;So, why did I stop? &lt;a class="anchor" href="#so-why-did-i-stop"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question. The truth is, I didn’t stop creating content—I just stopped publishing it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Looking forward to VMware Explore - the artist formerly known as VMworld</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/07/looking-forward-to-vmware-explore-the-artist-formerly-known-as-vmworld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/07/looking-forward-to-vmware-explore-the-artist-formerly-known-as-vmworld/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that my &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vmworld-europe-2013-arriving-and-day-1/"&gt;
 first VMworld
&lt;/a&gt; was almost 9 years ago! I feel very blessed to have attended in &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-day-one/"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years VMworld has been hugely formative in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked many times before about how the trajectory of my career really took off when I got involved with the London VMUG, and how that led to being awarded vExpert in 2013. Through the vExpert programme, I got my first blogger pass for VMworld, and from there the networking opportunities led to certification, career advances, and ultimately making the contacts (and friends) that got me in the door at VMware. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate how much VMworld has helped over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>2021 was great 2022 will be even better!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/2021-was-great-2022-will-be-even-better/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/2021-was-great-2022-will-be-even-better/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I am blessed to be working for a great employer, and while COVID had a significant impact everywhere, from a work point of view, I have never been busier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we are growing as an organisation, opportunities are surfacing on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus in the last 24 months has shifted from a more project to project focus to now being involved in several projects at once providing project and architectural governance as well as normal consultant duties. This has been challenging but really enjoyable. This means often I am not in the technical &amp;ldquo;weeds&amp;rdquo;, and exercising new skills and leaning on past experience.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization 2021 Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/11/vmware-certified-professional-data-center-virtualization-2021-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/11/vmware-certified-professional-data-center-virtualization-2021-exam-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Having not sat any VMware exams recently (MSC exam not including) I had to update my VMware certification status and therefore sit the VCP exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exam covers a broad spectrum of VMware technologies (vSphere, NSX-T, vSAN, Tanzu) I was apprehensive about it as there is an awful lot of material to cover that the exam expects you to have good knowledge of.

The whole Kubernetes ecosystem is a vast and nebulous beast, with new projects rising to the fore all the time, and old projects fading from favour. The size and rapid development that make the field so interesting and powerful, are the same properties that make the learning curve so steep, and the entry bar so high.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-cks-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-cks-exam-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist exam booked for a long time - so long in fact that the exam voucher was due to expire at the end of January 2022!

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - I&amp;rsquo;m leaving VMware PSO to join the Cloud Management Business Unit as a Technical Marketing Manager for Cloud Automation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over two years since I joined VMware as a Senior Conusltant in the EMEA NSX Practice, and in that time I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed some great opportunities, worked with some great people and technologies. And I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot since taking on my first NSX-T design just days after joining. But, as I &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/the-next-big-thing/" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; mentioned when I joined a couple of years ago
&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve always said NSX comes alive when it&amp;rsquo;s automated by vRA. In fact, almost every engagement I&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past two years has had a strong vein of automation running through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Am I the best I can be right now?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/03/am-i-the-best-i-can-be-right-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 09:55:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/03/am-i-the-best-i-can-be-right-now/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a few years since I read (and lost) a great article on career progression and personal insight. That article helped me relax into who I am from a professional point of view, but it also challenged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career. Talking to and observing peers whom I respected gave me a lot of inspiration to re-evaluate what I was doing in my career, why I did what I was doing and perhaps most importantly of all was I really being the best I can be?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>New Year, new things oh and a VCP7-CMA</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/01/new-year-new-things-oh-and-a-vcp7-cma/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2019 19:20:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/01/new-year-new-things-oh-and-a-vcp7-cma/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I have had time to write a blog post, the last quarter of last year was pretty crazy from a work point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it is now a New Year and my tech focus is turning very much on CMP related things particularly vRealize Automation. (I am also very much looking forward to learning more about VMware&amp;rsquo;s CaS which I saw demo&amp;rsquo;d at the UK VMUG late last year by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/grantorchard" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure if you ask that question to ten people you will get 10 different answers, or at the very least a wide variety of reasons. The product chosen to deliver the solution was a poor match, the product was implemented incorrectly, the PM sucked, the Vendor gave no support, insufficient training material/resources, poor interoperability, the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue I have observed from time to time on my travels is quite different from the above listed examples. In fact, (and this is my personal observation and opinion) the real issue can be hidden under the reasons listed above.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: Network and Security keynote and NSX-T Architecture Deep Dive #NET1863BE</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-network-and-security-keynote-and-nsx-t-architecture-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:19:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-network-and-security-keynote-and-nsx-t-architecture-deep-dive/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="transforming-networking-and-security-for-the-digital-era"&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Transforming Networking and Security for the Digital Era &lt;a class="anchor" href="#transforming-networking-and-security-for-the-digital-era"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday morning I attended the Network and Security keynote which, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I found to be a bit boring. To be fair, it was probably aimed at business leaders and maybe not those that are technical. There were three customer stories, but I would have liked to have heard much more about the problems that NSX solved for them specifically, rather than being datacenter transformation/cloud journey stories that included NSX. For me, it felt like there was nothing new in the presentation that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been covered in the general sessions. I would have liked to have seen and heard a bit more what the NSBU&amp;rsquo;s leadership think is going to be big over the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: Day Two General Session</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-day-two-general-session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-day-two-general-session/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was honoured to be asked to be part of VMware&amp;rsquo;s CrowdChat for the general sessions this year, the idea being to live-tweet the General Session as it progressed.

I am pleased to say that I passed the exam with a score of 422, way higher than I expected! I thought the exam itself was fair, and covered and tested the basics of vSAN well.

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I&amp;rsquo;m joining VMware as part of the PSO NSX practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression. And NSX is a rocket-ship that is gathering speed and momentum, it&amp;rsquo;s viewed by many as critical to the future of VMware as the public cloud begins to eat the more traditional datacenter. With so much focus on NSX at VMworld this year, I am convinced of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>So long, and thanks for all the fish…</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:06:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for Xtravirt for over 3 and a half years now, first as a Senior Consultant, and more recently as a Lead Consultant.

&lt;p&gt;OK so here it is, one thing I have observed for a good while now is how much noise there is about how -you- should be in the cloud (Public) and if you are not you&amp;rsquo;re already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call Bull****!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public, Hybrid and Private clouds are &lt;strong&gt;solutions&lt;/strong&gt; not final destinations, regardless of whether you are a customer, partner, or any other third thing you should be purely focused on what is best for you or (if you provide IT services) your customer. It is plainly obvious to me that in -all- of the customers I have visited there has been no appetite or reason to mass adopt any single one solution/option as it simply would not fit how they do business and function day to day. There will of course be exceptions to this rule but they are indeed exceptions not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How do you keep -your- IT skills relevant without burn out?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 08:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/skills.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having a chat with my Dad recently, about how those who work in IT keep their skills up to date. He is now retired but had spent 25+ years in the IT business so I always value his opinion. What occurred to me while we chewed the fat was the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended a workshop with Jad El Zein in Barcelona last year and it was one of the best sessions I attended, especially as it was just on the news of vRA7&amp;rsquo;s release. This workshop was this year&amp;rsquo;s equivelant, but because the session included a lot of people just getting started with vRA a lot of the time was taken to explain what vRA does, so there was no real time for the more in depth details on the new features that are coming (some already announced and in Tech Preview). I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t begrudge the guys just starting the chance to hear the basics from Jad, but I think a more expert session would also be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld 2016 – VCAP6-DCA Deploy Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-vcap6-dca-deploy-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 22:44:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-vcap6-dca-deploy-exam-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Greetings from Day 1 of VMworld US 2016!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year I try and make use of the VMworld discount at the exam centre, and this year was no exception I sat the VCAP6-DCV Deploy exam, and results are still pending! Overall it&amp;rsquo;s a good exam, there was very little of the spelling and grammatical errors I&amp;rsquo;ve complained about in the past, performance was OK and the level of difficulty was good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld 2016 – Day 0, #vmunderground opening acts, #beVCDX</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-day-0-vmunderground-opening-acts-bevcdx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 17:18:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-day-0-vmunderground-opening-acts-bevcdx/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I landed in Las Vegas about 9:30PM local time on Saturday evening, having not executed my plan to sleep on the flight! I had planned to sleep on the Toronto to Vegas leg, which would have meant I could head over to the Sips and Stogies pre-event, however a very rowdy hen do a couple of rows away meant that I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep at all, so I grabbed a taxi down to my hotel, the Excalibur, and got myself checked in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When everyones an Architect.. no one is..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/when-everyones-an-architect-no-one-is/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 10:34:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/when-everyones-an-architect-no-one-is/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is the first time I have written a &amp;ldquo;rant&amp;rdquo; post (for a while at least) so if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear me whine run away now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past 12 months I think I have met more folk with Architect in their job title than I truly believe is valid. Now I will be clear this is not a slight on the individuals all of them have been exceptional (at least the ones I have had the pleasure to work with).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
