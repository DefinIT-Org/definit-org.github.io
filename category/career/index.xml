As part of the CMBU and a long-standing vExpert it made sense for me to help out, and I was happy to do so. I reviewed ~60 of the applications that were in my area - automation. The experience was an eye-opener. What follows is a distillation of what (not) to do when you&amp;rsquo;re writing your application.</description></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</guid><description>Since I started learning Kubernetes the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam has been a target for me, but it&amp;rsquo;s always seemed to be out of reach. The whole Kubernetes ecosystem is a vast and nebulous beast, with new projects rising to the fore all the time, and old projects fading from favour. The size and rapid development that make the field so interesting and powerful, are the same properties that make the learning curve so steep, and the entry bar so high.</description></item><item><title>2020 - Simon's decade in review</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</guid><description>So it being 2020 now I thought it would be a pleasant exercise to quickly glance over the previous ten years and reflect a little. Before I even begin I will say I have never been happier in my career and work/life balance (which is always an on going effort to keep appropriate)
I am going to break it down in a yearly format and then summarize at the end.</description></item><item><title>Goodbye VMware PSO...</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/09/goodbye-vmware-pso.../</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/09/goodbye-vmware-pso.../</guid><description>Autumn seems to be a time for the winds of change to blow through our industry, and this year that&amp;rsquo;s true for me.
TL;DR - I&amp;rsquo;m leaving VMware PSO to join the Cloud Management Business Unit as a Technical Marketing Manager for Cloud Automation!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over two years since I joined VMware as a Senior Conusltant in the EMEA NSX Practice, and in that time I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed some great opportunities, worked with some great people and technologies.</description></item><item><title>Am I the best I can be right now?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/03/am-i-the-best-i-can-be-right-now/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2019 09:55:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/03/am-i-the-best-i-can-be-right-now/</guid><description>It has been a few years since I read (and lost) a great article on career progression and personal insight. That article helped me relax into who I am from a professional point of view, but it also challenged me.
I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career.</description></item><item><title>New Year, new things oh and a VCP7-CMA</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/01/new-year-new-things-oh-and-a-vcp7-cma/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Jan 2019 19:20:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/01/new-year-new-things-oh-and-a-vcp7-cma/</guid><description>It has been a while since I have had time to write a blog post, the last quarter of last year was pretty crazy from a work point of view.
Regardless, it is now a New Year and my tech focus is turning very much on CMP related things particularly vRealize Automation. (I am also very much looking forward to learning more about VMware&amp;rsquo;s CaS which I saw demo&amp;rsquo;d at the UK VMUG late last year by Grant Orchard)</description></item><item><title>Looking back on 2017 and looking forward into 2018</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/looking-back-on-2017-and-looking-forward-into-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:59:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/looking-back-on-2017-and-looking-forward-into-2018/</guid><description>Upon seeing others in the wider community making a blog post like this as a marker in the sand I thought I would follow suit as a way to see what I have learned and goals I would like to achieve in the coming year. 2017 was a good year and a very busy one at that, I got to see a lot of new places on my work travels and met some really amazing, clever and talented people.</description></item><item><title>Why do IT projects struggle or fail?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/why-do-it-projects-struggle-or-fail/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 22:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/why-do-it-projects-struggle-or-fail/</guid><description>Why do IT projects fail?
I am sure if you ask that question to ten people you will get 10 different answers, or at the very least a wide variety of reasons. The product chosen to deliver the solution was a poor match, the product was implemented incorrectly, the PM sucked, the Vendor gave no support, insufficient training material/resources, poor interoperability, the list goes on and on.
One issue I have observed from time to time on my travels is quite different from the above listed examples.</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: Network and Security keynote and NSX-T Architecture Deep Dive #NET1863BE</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-network-and-security-keynote-and-nsx-t-architecture-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 14:19:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-network-and-security-keynote-and-nsx-t-architecture-deep-dive/</guid><description>Transforming Networking and Security for the Digital Era Wednesday morning I attended the Network and Security keynote which, if I&amp;rsquo;m honest, I found to be a bit boring. To be fair, it was probably aimed at business leaders and maybe not those that are technical. There were three customer stories, but I would have liked to have heard much more about the problems that NSX solved for them specifically, rather than being datacenter transformation/cloud journey stories that included NSX.</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: Day Two General Session</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-day-two-general-session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-day-two-general-session/</guid><description>I was honoured to be asked to be part of VMware&amp;rsquo;s CrowdChat for the general sessions this year, the idea being to live-tweet the General Session as it progressed.

At that point I was content to live the contractor life for a year or so and see what opportunities came along. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect opportunity to come along so quickly!
TLDR; I&amp;rsquo;m joining VMware as part of the PSO NSX practice!
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression.</description></item><item><title>So long, and thanks for all the fish…</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:06:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for Xtravirt for over 3 and a half years now, first as a Senior Consultant, and more recently as a Lead Consultant.

I&amp;rsquo;ve developed and grown as a consultant and architect, achieved multiple VCP and VCAP qualifications, and VMware&amp;rsquo;s elite VCDX certification. For all of this, and for the opportunities and support they have provided, I am thankful to Xtravirt and to all of my colleagues who helped along the way.</description></item><item><title>There is no one cloud solution to rule them all..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/there-is-no-one-cloud-solution-to-rule-them-all/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 17:01:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/there-is-no-one-cloud-solution-to-rule-them-all/</guid><description>I have been musing this a little while and decided to write this post/rant/opinion post, feel free to post your thoughts and opinions in the comments.
OK so here it is, one thing I have observed for a good while now is how much noise there is about how -you- should be in the cloud (Public) and if you are not you&amp;rsquo;re already dead.
I call Bull****!
Public, Hybrid and Private clouds are solutions not final destinations, regardless of whether you are a customer, partner, or any other third thing you should be purely focused on what is best for you or (if you provide IT services) your customer.</description></item><item><title>How do you keep -your- IT skills relevant without burn out?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 08:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</guid><description>I was having a chat with my Dad recently, about how those who work in IT keep their skills up to date.

If there is one thing we can be sure of in IT, it is that change will happen and faster than we think.</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2016 – Day 2 workshops and sessions</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-day-2-workshops-and-sessions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 16:50:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-day-2-workshops-and-sessions/</guid><description>vRealize Automation vExperts Workshop I attended a workshop with Jad El Zein in Barcelona last year and it was one of the best sessions I attended, especially as it was just on the news of vRA7&amp;rsquo;s release.
