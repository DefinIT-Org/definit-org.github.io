&lt;p&gt;I looked back and realised the last time I posted here was July 2022—almost three years ago! It’s hard to believe how quickly that time has flown. Consider this post a signal of intent: I’m planning to start publishing content here once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question. The truth is, I didn’t stop creating content—I just stopped publishing it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Expert - Multi-Cloud Builder</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/11/vmware-cloud-expert-multi-cloud-builder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/11/vmware-cloud-expert-multi-cloud-builder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the good fortune to be invited to attend a VMware Multi-Cloud course at VMware UK HQ in Staines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course took place over 4 days and was very well structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialy, we were given the VMware vision on Multi-Cloud and then we were straight into the &amp;ldquo;good stuff&amp;rdquo; hands-on-labs. This would be a consistent and well executed theme for the 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware now have an impressive global cloud presence utilising their partnerships with major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and several others.

&lt;p&gt;Over the years VMworld has been hugely formative in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked many times before about how the trajectory of my career really took off when I got involved with the London VMUG, and how that led to being awarded vExpert in 2013. Through the vExpert programme, I got my first blogger pass for VMworld, and from there the networking opportunities led to certification, career advances, and ultimately making the contacts (and friends) that got me in the door at VMware. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate how much VMworld has helped over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCF Host pNIC Change Limitations</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/04/vcf-host-pnic-change-limitations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/04/vcf-host-pnic-change-limitations/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I stumbled upon a limitation in VCF that isn&amp;rsquo;t very clearly documented, and while not an issue you would regularly come accross.

&lt;p&gt;Virtual conference event fatigue is real. I have attended and presented at many since the pandemic began, with varying levels of engagement. As an introvert, I can&amp;rsquo;t quite believe I&amp;rsquo;m saying this, but I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get pack to meeting up with people in the real world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of a conference is super-charged by the mix of dedicated time, networking opportunities and quality live content. Unfortunately for me a virtual conference tends to be diluted by distractions on-screen (and off) and is missing the key ingredient of those haphazard incidental meetups in the conference center. And whether you prefer on-demand pre-recorded content or not, for me it loses some of it&amp;rsquo;s appeal when you know the mistakes are edited out. And yes, I edit out my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Workaround: Adding an external vRealize Orchestrator 8.x instance to Code Stream</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/workaround-adding-an-external-vrealize-orchestrator-8.x-instance-to-code-stream/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/workaround-adding-an-external-vrealize-orchestrator-8.x-instance-to-code-stream/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was doing some testing with adding an external vRealize Orchestrator 8.4 endpoint to vRealize Automation Code Stream 8.4, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a redirect that happens with the vRO 8.4 appliance that makes the endpoint validation fail.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago VMware released the Orchestrator MP which is a superb way to directly call vRO workflows from vROps by way of alerts and actions. This opens the door to all manner of ideas for conditional automation using vROps.&lt;/p&gt;

A more repeatable way is to create a Custom Integration that takes the two inputs, and returns the encoded header as an output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the Custom Integration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Custom Integration named &amp;ldquo;Create Basic Authentication Header&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Runtime - the examples below are &lt;code&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; respectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the placeholder code with the example from below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save and version the Custom Integration, ensuring you eanble the &amp;ldquo;Release Version&amp;rdquo; toggle&lt;/li&gt;

For the most part, I try and keep my applications and configurations stateless - relying on &lt;code&gt;ConfigMaps&lt;/code&gt; for example to store application configuration. This means with a handful of YAML files in my Git repository I can restore everything to working order. Sometimes though, there&amp;rsquo;s no choice but to use a &lt;code&gt;PersistentVolume&lt;/code&gt; to provide some data persistance where you can&amp;rsquo;t capture it in a config file.

They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card. SD cards are notorious for having high attrition rates, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re reading/writing to them regularly. Running a Kubernetes cluster on my Raspberry Pis is especially hard on the SD card because you&amp;rsquo;re not only running the system&amp;rsquo;s read and writes, but you&amp;rsquo;re also running containers and their I/O on the card.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vExpert 2020 holographic sticker charity giveaway!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/vexpert-2020-holographic-sticker-charity-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/vexpert-2020-holographic-sticker-charity-giveaway/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - the first 50 vExperts to sign up on &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/adfsWN29boZBhMDT6" target="_blank"&gt;

 moving to Hugo as a publishing platform for this blog
&lt;/a&gt;, this post is a bit more about how I&amp;rsquo;m managing the publishing using GitLab&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD Pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I need to mention that I&amp;rsquo;m using three different repositories for my code base, and why. The three repositories are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definit-hugo - this contains the hugo site configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definit-content - this contains the site content - markdown files, images etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definit-theme - this contains the VMware Clarity-based theme I use for my site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;definit-content&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;definit-theme&lt;/strong&gt; are git submodules in the &lt;strong&gt;definit-hugo&lt;/strong&gt; project, mapped into the /content and /themes folders respectively. This allows me to keep the configuration, content and theme separate, and to manage them as separate entities. The aim is that the theme will eventually be in a position to be released, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to extract it from my hugo code base later on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>2020 - Simon's decade in review</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So it being 2020 now I thought it would be a pleasant exercise to quickly glance

&lt;p&gt;Until recently a single PhotonOS VM with Docker was all I needed to run - everything shared the same host IP, stored it&amp;rsquo;s configuration locally or on an NFS mount and generally ran fine. However, my wife and kids have become more dependant on plex, and homebridge (which I use to control the air conditioning in my house), and if they&amp;rsquo;re down, it&amp;rsquo;s a problem. So, I embarked on a little project to provide some better availability, and learn a little in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation - Deployment Observations</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/07/vmware-cloud-foundation-deployment-observations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/07/vmware-cloud-foundation-deployment-observations/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working with VMware Cloud Foundation recently and while for the most part things went well there were occasions where challenges were encountered which made the delivery to the customer all the more trickier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

drop down a level and get more familiar with the inner workings for Kubernetes,

&lt;p&gt;Cody has gone down the route of using Hugo and AWS, which I respect, but just seems like too much work for me at the moment! I am familiar with WordPress, and Simon is barely computer literate at the best of times, so I can&amp;rsquo;t ask him to start writing in markdown. But I did want some of this Clarity goodness - so I set about learning how to create a WordPress theme, and how to integrate Clarity with this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GDPR, blogging and DefinIT</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2018 20:46:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So…this is a frustrated sort of post. As you are most likely to already know, the new data protection laws (GDPR) are coming into effect on the 25th May 2018. I must emphasise that &lt;strong&gt;I am not an expert on GDPR&lt;/strong&gt;, this post is my layman’s conclusion for my specific circumstances. I run this blog as an exercise to help others, provide information and as a hobby. There is a lot of speculation around how this will affect bloggers, and a lot of panic and mis-information too. I’ve seen a few people this week simply shut down and delete their blogs - which is both upsetting and sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Lifecycle Manager 1.2 VC data collection fails when NSX-T hostswitches are in use</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/04/vrealize-lifecycle-manager-1-2-vc-data-collection-fails-when-nsx-t-hostswitches-are-in-use/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 10:17:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/04/vrealize-lifecycle-manager-1-2-vc-data-collection-fails-when-nsx-t-hostswitches-are-in-use/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;When vRealize Lifecycle Manager 1.2 was released recently, I was keen to get it installed in my lab, since I maintain several vRealize Automation deployments for development and testing, as well as performing upgrades.

The simple answer is that I used to make something up as I went along, deploying components by hand and generally repeating myself a lot. I had some cut/paste commands in my note application that sped things up a little, but nothing that developed. I’ve been meaning to rectify this for a while, and this is the result!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Retrieve Blueprint or Virtual Machine Custom Properties using the vRealize Automation API</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/02/retrieve-blueprint-or-virtual-machine-custom-properties-using-the-vrealize-automation-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 14:11:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/02/retrieve-blueprint-or-virtual-machine-custom-properties-using-the-vrealize-automation-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Just a quick post today, as I was working with a customer recently and we were trying to retrieve the Custom Properties assigned to a vRealize Automation 7.3 deployed Virtual Machine, similar to the one in the image below. It’s not as intuitive as you’d like it to be because of the split between IaaS APIs and Cafe APIs.

The current integration also enables a method to deploy micro-segmentation out of the box, based on dynamic Security Group membership and the Service Composer. This method does have some limitations, and can be inflexible for the on-going management of deployed applications. It requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of NSX and the Distributed Firewall, as well as access to the Networking and Security manager that is hosted by vCenter Server.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps data retention and the Cleaner</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/vrops-data-retention-and-the-cleaner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jan 2018 13:36:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/vrops-data-retention-and-the-cleaner/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Something that has come up with customers recently is why and when old data is cleaned up from your vROps instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure if you ask that question to ten people you will get 10 different answers, or at the very least a wide variety of reasons. The product chosen to deliver the solution was a poor match, the product was implemented incorrectly, the PM sucked, the Vendor gave no support, insufficient training material/resources, poor interoperability, the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

To be fair, it was probably aimed at business leaders and maybe not those that are technical. There were three customer stories, but I would have liked to have heard much more about the problems that NSX solved for them specifically, rather than being datacenter transformation/cloud journey stories that included NSX. For me, it felt like there was nothing new in the presentation that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been covered in the general sessions. I would have liked to have seen and heard a bit more what the NSBU&amp;rsquo;s leadership think is going to be big over the next 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: Day Two General Session</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-day-two-general-session/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 13:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-day-two-general-session/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was honoured to be asked to be part of VMware&amp;rsquo;s CrowdChat for the general sessions this year, the idea being to live-tweet the General Session as it progressed.

&lt;p&gt;I found the Kubernetes session really enjoyable and really felt like the speakers delivered a great overview of the integration and how they work together.

And NSX is a rocket-ship that is gathering speed and momentum, it&amp;rsquo;s viewed by many as critical to the future of VMware as the public cloud begins to eat the more traditional datacenter. With so much focus on NSX at VMworld this year, I am convinced of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2017 – Announcing Part 4 : Optimizing Workload Performance Using Automation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/vrops-webinar-2017-announcing-part-4-optimizing-workload-performance-using-automation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Sep 2017 13:18:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/vrops-webinar-2017-announcing-part-4-optimizing-workload-performance-using-automation/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/03/logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;In this coming episode, Sunny will DIVE DEEP into the interesting topic of introducing automation into operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying vCHA can be done in two modes - &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;. You can use Basic mode if the vCenter you want to be HA is managing the hosts it resides on - in this scenario the wizard configures your vCenter and deploys the Passive and Witness nodes for you. If you have a management cluster for your vCenter Server, or you are deploying a nested environment, you need to use the advanced mode - in this scenario you must configure your active node, deploy clones for the passive and witness nodes, then enable the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 2- Full Stack monitoring with vRealize Operations Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/05/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-2-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 07:18:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/05/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-2-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;lt;img class=&amp;ldquo;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8035&amp;rdquo; src=&amp;quot;/images/2017/03/logo.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; which vROps can provide by using various extensibility solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

Last time around we looked closely into the features of vROps 6.5 and as stated during that webinar, we will now show you how you can unlock the full capabilities of vROps using the extensibility of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been following the Webinar Series, by now you have a complete visibility into the capabilities of vROps, when it comes to monitoring the vSphere infrastructure. While this infrastructure is important for the IaaS provider, what business cares about is Applications. The good news is that vROps provides you an extensible platform which can be leveraged to extend the product capability into any area where metrics exist. This could be at the layers of your Software Defined Datacenter such as Compute, Network &amp;amp; Storage, or in the Application Stack and it&amp;rsquo;s tiers such as App, Web and DB.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps hidden gem – XML Builder</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-hidden-gem-xml-builder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 08:06:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-hidden-gem-xml-builder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;If you spend a good amount of time in vROps either at your place of work or with customers (like me) you will likely  have had to create some custom XML (metric configuration) for custom dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past you would either use the sample/examples to get them started and then go and find the specific metric names while, this was usually quite time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent versions of vROps however, VMware have introduced a &amp;ldquo;builder&amp;rdquo; to help you properly format and slect the corect adapters/adapterkinds and metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Alexa, turn on my workload cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 15:05:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I already have a vRealize Orchestrator workflow to shutdown my workload cluster. What I want to do is trigger that by a voice command from Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the correct and proper thing to do here would be to create a new Alexa skill, write the function in Lambda and connect that to my Orchestrator REST API and execute the workflow. That way I could control the “intents” and “utterances” and have verbal feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 1 – What’s New with vROps 6.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:02:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/03/logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;Time to share the recording of the first episode of the vROps Webinar Series 2017. This time around, Sunny and I spoke about the latest release of vRealize Operations Manager. We spoke about almost all the new features which were introduced with this version and went into some of them in detail. Like always we rounded up the session with Live Demo of the new features for our audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduced a feedback form which can be used to provide your feedback in general and also request topics on which you would want us to focus this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Understanding #vROps High Availability</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/understanding-vrops-high-availability/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 19:32:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/understanding-vrops-high-availability/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;While there is a reasonable amount of information about how HA works in vROps I have found there is still some confusion as to how HA actually works with vROps or rather what are the benefits and perhaps more importantly the cost for enabling the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HA is a great feature and in my opinion should be considered seriously with any deployment (where possible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does HA protect your Master node (which essentially behaves as an index for your vROps cluster and if lost will render your cluster dead unless you have a working backup of your cluster) it will also allow your cluster to tolerate a data node failure. So in short what is not to like!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.5 – Two new enhancements/features I really liked</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 08:37:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;So vROps 6.5 has been out for around a month now and I finally have a little while to write a post on what I personally really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of great new enhancements and improvements added in 6.5 but for the sake of brevity I shall highlight two that I really liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="flexibility-to-increase-ram-in-between-node-sizes"&gt;Flexibility to increase RAM in between node sizes &lt;a class="anchor" href="#flexibility-to-increase-ram-in-between-node-sizes"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are familiar with vROps you will know that when you deploy it you have &amp;ldquo;T-Shirt&amp;rdquo; sizes to choose from, Small, Medium, Large and now Extra Large (6.5). However an additional extra in 6.5 is support to increase the memory allocation of your vROps nodes, you will not require additional CPU for the node until you hit the next node size bracket. If in doubt check the &lt;a href="https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2093783" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; VMware has provided so you can be sure on what you can and cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing #vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 1 – What’s new in 6.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/announcing-vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-in-6-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2017 10:58:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/announcing-vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-in-6-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/03/logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;Welcome to the vRealize Operations Manager Webinar Series 2017.

I have lost count of the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to help troubleshoot an issue that, when asked, people don&amp;rsquo;t know which log they should be looking at. The simple fact is that vRealize Automation has a lot of log files.

&lt;p&gt;In most cases the innovations and new tech are ground breaking awesomeness and most certainly offer new opportunities for the infrastructure masses.&lt;/p&gt;

With the release of NSX 6.3 and vSphere 6.5a, I can now upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic. Then second reason is throughput - each NSX Edge is capable of ~10Gbps throughput, but with ECMP we can have multiple NSX Edges (up to 8) providing 10Gbps each - that&amp;rsquo;s a significant performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator Workflow: shutdownVSANCluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;My vSphere lab is split into two halves - a low power management cluster, powered by 3 Intel NUCs, and a more hefty workload cluster powered by a Dell C6100 chassis with 3 nodes.

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some ideas in my lab to leverage the AWS endpoint on vRealize Automation. One of the things I needed to get working was getting Software Components working on my AWS deployed instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram to the right shows my end-stage network - the instance deployed by vRA into AWS should be in a private subnet in my VPC, and should use my local lab DNS server and be able to access my vRA instance. This allows me to make use of the vRA guest agent for software components on the deployed VMs. I also wanted to have the deployed VMs use their local NAT gateway for internet traffic, rather than paying for the data over my VPN connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating an AWS Hardware VPN Connection with Ubiquiti EdgeRouterX</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/creating-an-aws-hardware-vpn-connection-with-ubiquiti-edgerouterx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 22:38:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/creating-an-aws-hardware-vpn-connection-with-ubiquiti-edgerouterx/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/11/Multiple_VPN_Tunnels_diagram.png" alt=""&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working with Amazon and vRealize Automation Software Components, one of the requirements is for the Guest Agent (gugent) to talk back to the vRealize Automation APIs - the gugent polls the API for tasks it should perform, downloads them from the API and executes them, then updates the tasks with a status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that Virtual Machines deployed as EC2 instances in an AWS VPC require the ability to talk back to internal corporate networks - not something you&amp;rsquo;d want to publish on the internet! That&amp;rsquo;s where AWS&amp;rsquo;s VPN connections come in - you can create several types of VPN that allow such communication over a secure (encrypted) virtual private network.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Security “fun” and embracing 2FA</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/security-fun-and-embracing-2fa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 10:47:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/security-fun-and-embracing-2fa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/11/Two-Factor_Image.png" alt=""&gt;So the other day my Skype account was briefly compromised, a successful login from Russia (after digging through activity logs) and this was after many attempts from IP addresses all around the world (China, Korea, Argentina the list goes on).

I did a brief search on the web to see what material was &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; on how to perform what is a straight forward task. To my surprise very little came up. So I have decided to create this guide with all the things you need to consider when you are going to either expand or need to remove a node from one of your active vROps deployments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2016 – Part 10 – A Deep Dive into vROps API</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-series-2016-part-10-a-deep-dive-into-vrops-api/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2016 12:37:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/vrops-webinar-series-2016-part-10-a-deep-dive-into-vrops-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Time to publish the recording for the 10th episode of vROps Webinar Series. This time around we spoke about vRealize Operations Manager Resful API and how to use it.

This time around we will talk about vRealize Operations Manager API. API is your friend if you are trying to automate things which you would normally do on GUI. While GUI is a favourite of most, the geeks prefer the API since that helps them to programatically initiate tasks and go out for a coffee. By the time they are back from the LONG coffee break, the work is done 🙂&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>There is no one cloud solution to rule them all..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/there-is-no-one-cloud-solution-to-rule-them-all/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 17:01:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/there-is-no-one-cloud-solution-to-rule-them-all/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/theonering.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been musing this a little while and decided to write this post/rant/opinion post, feel free to post your thoughts and opinions in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK so here it is, one thing I have observed for a good while now is how much noise there is about how -you- should be in the cloud (Public) and if you are not you&amp;rsquo;re already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call Bull****!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public, Hybrid and Private clouds are &lt;strong&gt;solutions&lt;/strong&gt; not final destinations, regardless of whether you are a customer, partner, or any other third thing you should be purely focused on what is best for you or (if you provide IT services) your customer. It is plainly obvious to me that in -all- of the customers I have visited there has been no appetite or reason to mass adopt any single one solution/option as it simply would not fit how they do business and function day to day. There will of course be exceptions to this rule but they are indeed exceptions not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing .NET core, PowerShell and PowerCLI on macOS Sierra</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/installing-net-core-powershell-and-powercli-on-macos-sierra/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 10:52:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/installing-net-core-powershell-and-powercli-on-macos-sierra/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/powerclicore140x140.jpg" alt=""&gt;So, this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to write up for a while! PowerShell for macOS has been available for a while now, but what a lot of PowerCLI fans have been waiting for is to be able to use PowerCLI direct from their Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, amidst all of the noise from VMWorld, PowerCLI Core dropped as a Fling! That means that although it&amp;rsquo;s not ready for production use yet, it is ready to start testing - and I&amp;rsquo;m way more excited than I should be!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How do you keep -your- IT skills relevant without burn out?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 08:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/skills.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

During this episode we discussed about the new features and functionalities of vRealize Operations Manager 6.3. With this release of the product, we can clearly see that VMware is clearly working on enhancing the user experience and the user interface with some great new features and UI changes.&lt;/p&gt;

As we move towards winter, we would like to take a zoom out view at the vRealize Operations Manager solution with a What&amp;rsquo;s New Episode. For the past 8 months, we have give pretty deep into most of the product features and we believe it is time when we review the product in it&amp;rsquo;s current form and shape. In my opinion, this could not be done better than sharing about the new features &amp;amp; functionalities available in the latest version of vRealize Operations Manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Web Client – VSAN is Turned Off – Edit button disappears</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/09/vsphere-web-client-vsan-is-turned-off-edit-button-disappears/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2016 16:10:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/09/vsphere-web-client-vsan-is-turned-off-edit-button-disappears/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into a strange one with my lab today where the previously working VSAN cluster couldn&amp;rsquo;t be enabled.

This workshop was this year&amp;rsquo;s equivelant, but because the session included a lot of people just getting started with vRA a lot of the time was taken to explain what vRA does, so there was no real time for the more in depth details on the new features that are coming (some already announced and in Tech Preview). I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t begrudge the guys just starting the chance to hear the basics from Jad, but I think a more expert session would also be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Part 8 : SDDC Operations with vROps Custom Dashboards</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vrops-webinar-2016-part-8-sddc-operations-with-vrops-custom-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2016 14:52:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vrops-webinar-2016-part-8-sddc-operations-with-vrops-custom-dashboards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;With today, being the last day of the month, we wanted to make sure that we share this out with you folks out there to keep up with the practice.&lt;/p&gt;

However 9/10 customers wanted to use SNMP and with vROps it was a question of switching on the fire-hose and pointing it to the receiver and let that end point or middle-ware handle the torrent of data. This was naturally not always well received and in some cases rendered that option as a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld 2016 – VCAP6-DCA Deploy Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-vcap6-dca-deploy-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2016 22:44:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vmworld-2016-vcap6-dca-deploy-exam-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Greetings from Day 1 of VMworld US 2016!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this time around we will move our focus from vROps as a Product and related features to the concept of running your SDDC operations with vRealize Operations Dashboards. Just to clarify, this is not a session where we will teach you to create dashboards, but this is a session where we would share how a set of Customised Dashboards can help any organisation&amp;rsquo;s IT to get an insight into Storage, Network &amp;amp; Compute within your SDDC. While vROps is primarily a Performance Management and Capacity Planning tool, we will take you to the other important aspects as well such as Availability and Configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Part 7 : Working with Alerts &amp; Symptoms</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2016 09:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;Time to release the recording for the latest part of the vROps Webinar Series. We completed the 7th session of the series where we spoke about vRealize Operations Manager Alerts and Symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alerts as we all know would always remain the heart and soul for the operations teams to run the data centers, whether old school or the modern software defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases you need alerts and more importantly you need meaningful and actionable alerts. In this part of the series, Simon and myself concentrated on making you aware of the alert constructs in vROps and as usual share experiences around how we help customers leverage the strong feature set of vROps to customize alerts and related symptoms, recommendations and actions to drastically reduce the Mean Time to Resolution of issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Adding an AWS endpoint to vRealize Automation 7</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/adding-an-amazon-web-services-endpoint-to-vrealize-automation-7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2016 09:46:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/adding-an-amazon-web-services-endpoint-to-vrealize-automation-7/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Although it&amp;rsquo;s fairly limited, you can add AWS as an endpoint for vRealize Automation 7  and consume EC2 AMIs as part of a blueprint.

Sure its quite self indulgent but seeing other people&amp;rsquo;s lists gives you a small glimpse into their life. After all musical taste is a hugely personal thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached my top 10 by considering which bands and albums had the biggest impact on me at a given time in my life and that I still enjoy today.

 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; Sunny
&lt;/a&gt; and I thought about discussing Architecture of vROps. To some, it might sound strange as for smaller deployments you might not have to worry about Sizing and Architecture much since it is pretty simple to install and configure a small or a medium node for a small shop. However as your monitoring needs grow and you start adding solutions for monitoring data sources beyond vSphere, you would need to think about scaling up or scaling out. As your monitoring environment weaves into your incident ticketing system, you would start to see the need to HA of vROps and as you have a DR strategy for your workloads, you will start thinking about DR for your operations tools as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Log Insight services not starting after cluster IP changes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/log-insight-services-not-starting-after-cluster-ip-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2016 15:26:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/log-insight-services-not-starting-after-cluster-ip-changes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I ran into this problem at a customer site where all the Log Insight nodes were changed due to some IP address conflicts. I think the problem occurred because the IP addresses were all changed and the VMs shut down, without time for the application to update the node IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web interface was down, a &lt;em&gt;netstat -ano | grep -i “443”&lt;/em&gt; showed the service was listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/var/log/loginsight/runtime.log contains warning messages about “Cassandra cluster not ready yet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running /usr/lib/loginsight/application/lib/apache-cassandra-*/bin/nodetool status showed the two data nodes down (DN) and used the old IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the nodes were up with their new IP addresses, however Cassandra on the Master node was still looking for the old IP addresses for the Worker nodes. The Worker nodes were in a similar state, knowing their own new IP addresses but not being able to update the Master node because they didn’t have the Master node’s new IP address.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if I want full metrics? in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;If you have used vCOps (previous version of vROPs) you will likely remember the option in the admin panel where you could change the number of metrics being collected from &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to configure vCloud Air as a vCloud Director host in vRealize Orchestrator in order to create some custom resource actions for Day 2 operations in vRealize Automation. What I found was that there&amp;rsquo;s *very* little information out there on how to do this, and I ended up writing my own custom resource mapping for the virtual machines to VCAC:VirtualMachine objects - at least that way I could add my resource action. But this still didn&amp;rsquo;t expose the vCloud Director functionality for those machines. To do this I needed vCloud Air added as a vCloud Director host.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps what if I want to scale up?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-what-if-i-want-to-scale-up/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 21:42:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-what-if-i-want-to-scale-up/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;So a lot of noise is being made about vROps being able to scale out and rightly so it works -very- well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However what if you want to scale up your node or nodes, going from say small to medium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps your POC has proved so useful you want to move it into production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have lots of really useful historical on your existing smaller build and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to redeploy (therefore losing your historical data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have limitations where scaling out is simply not an option but you need vROps to take on more work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are likely other compelling reasons for you to want to scale up your vROps nodes so lets look at how we can do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 4 : Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 11:33:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;We hope you are having fun with the &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/starting-2016-with-a-bang-vrops-webinar-series/" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Automation Action Framework (AAF) is one of these, a really powerful vROps in-built automation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when I have discussed this capability with my peers and friends many ask why not use vRO etc? My reply is quite simple, &amp;ldquo;what if you do not have vRO or the in house skills to utilise it properly?&amp;rdquo; also &amp;ldquo;With the AAF you do -not- need any scripting knowledge or have to setup any workflows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What’s in my vRA7 EBS Payloads?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/whats-in-my-vra7-ebs-payloads/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 15:52:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/whats-in-my-vra7-ebs-payloads/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;img class=&amp;ldquo;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6186&amp;rdquo; src=&amp;quot;/images/2015/07/vRA-Product-Icon-Mac_0.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;vRA&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; - a properties object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a workflow that I could enable to log all of the keys, values and types of the properties object for each stage of the vRA7 MachineProvisioning workflows, and create a reference for myself on the payload for each stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this I created a new workflow &amp;ldquo;debugProperties&amp;rdquo; and added an input variable called &amp;ldquo;payload&amp;rdquo;, type Properties. Next I added a single scriptable task and cycled through the properties. Some of the properties&amp;rsquo; values are actually other properties objects, so there&amp;rsquo;s a function to test the type and iterate through if required.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 : Part 3 – Capacity Planning De-Mystified!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/vrops-webinar-2016-part-3-capacity-planning-de-mystified/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 16:29:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/vrops-webinar-2016-part-3-capacity-planning-de-mystified/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capacity Planning Demystified!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capacity Planning is an integral part of vRealize Operations Manager and through this session we want to de-mystify the concepts of Capacity Planning in vROps using features such as projects and the out-of-box capacity views. We look at defining the capacity planning policies based on the business requirements of an organization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we would now take you to the world of vRealize Operations Policies Policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Policy??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; Wikipedia
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the role of vRealize Operations Manager is to help you with Performance &amp;amp; Capacity Management of your Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC), it is important that you feed in the guiding principles of your Business Environment into vROps to get the rational outcomes. These outcomes span across Health, Risk &amp;amp; Efficiency of your SDDC environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.2 – upgrade and utilization dashboards</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:25:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;As you will see the upgrade is simple and even though its early days I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything that has been broken!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at what’s new very quickly there are some good new enhancements but when you compare this to the 6.1 release it’s perhaps a little light, nevertheless there appears to be some new cool features and enhancements to be had in this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any sizing/scale increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 nodes if you are on versions 6.0.x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 nodes if you are on version 6.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter if you plan to use SNMP with your vROps cluster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simple really, what I discovered today is that even though you have a master node SNMP traps can and will be sent from all of the nodes to the destination you have configured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG &amp;ndash; Curry &amp;ndash; Beer &amp;ndash; Sessions &amp;ndash; Weddings</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vmug-usercon_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;This was my second UKVMUG and it was my first vCurry evening! so I was really looking forward to getting up to the event and seeing everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

I hope that it was helpful and maybe a few of you will be building some awesome labs in the cloud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravello very kindly sponsored a free home lab, equivalent to the vExpert 1000 hours account as a prize for my session at the UKVMUG yesterday. Using a high tech random number generator and an Excel spread sheet the winner was picked, so without further ado, congratulations go to…&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MindMap: vRealize Automation Roles</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/mindmap-vrealize-automation-roles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:45:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/mindmap-vrealize-automation-roles/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I use mind maps quite a lot for study, I find the visual representation of info makes it a lot easier for me to remember!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apologies in advance if this is post is a jumbled nonsense, I&amp;rsquo;m still way too excited!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke to the news that I have passed my VCDX-CMA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second attempt at VCDX and although the first failure was a painful experience, the lessons learned from it were invaluable to take into the defence the second time around. Failing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a negative experience - if there is one thing that I will take from the VCDX program it is that there is ALWAYS more I need to learn, and I can always do better. Learning has to be a way of life (in this industry especially!) and the minute you stop, you start falling back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015 – Days 3 and 4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-2015-days-3-and-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2015 21:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-2015-days-3-and-4/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="wednesday"&gt;Wednesday &lt;a class="anchor" href="#wednesday"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had lined up several sessions so I was quick to get along to my first session - Operational Remediation with vRealize Operations… Tying it All Together - #MGT5735. The session was excellent and gave a great overview and introduction to what is possible with remediation in vROps 6.1. Big thanks to Chima Njaka for this session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely automated deployment…almost. The deployment of appliances and installation of IaaS components and pre-requisites will be wizard driven, the Window Servers will need to exist and have an agent installed, and the MSSQL server will also need to be installed. Anyone who’s done a distributed vRA install will know that this is a massive improvement over the current state of affairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vRealize Automation appliances will be clustered automatically for core services such as identity, cafe (portal), vPostgres and embedded vRealize Orchestrator (Embedded vRO is now recommended for production).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new identity service. No more vSphere SSO or PSC – VMware Identity Management (vIDM) is a new, highly scalable and performing federated identity platform. Any SAML identity source, and more than 3m users supported per source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An initial setup wizard that creates your first tenant, configuring things like fabric groups, business groups and vSphere endpoints automatically. It will even import your existing vSphere templates as clone blueprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old CDK is gone! Instead you can use any event within vRA that is pushed through the RabbitMQ message bus to trigger extensibility through workflow subscriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vRealize Orchestrator has a new HTML5 Control Center which is your single admin point for plugin configuration as well as adding metrics and monitoring for all workflows being executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no need for unique tenant URLs – the new vIDM platform allows a single logon interface for all tenants. (Though you can keep your URLs if you want!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vIDM can also be used to control authentication from IP source, e.g. to restrict logon to a specific subnet regardless of whether the credentials are valid or not. This has some cool ramifications for having the web layer in a DMZ, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functionality is slowly being migrated from the old IaaS/DynamicOps layer to the appliance – this is fantastic news. The migrated portions (such as vSphere Endpoint configuration) are now accessible through the vRA API, as well as gaining the speed and stability that the appliances provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new blueprint designer is awesome. Added to that what was AppD is now called App Services and allows you to take a base blueprint (e.g. a CentOS VM) and drag and drop software components that you’ve scripted on top (e.g. Apache, then PHP). You can also drag and drop XaaS (vRO workflows) onto the blueprint, as well as existing blueprints to create nested blueprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much fuller integration between NSX and vRA. There’s a whole raft of improvements in the integration between vRA and NSX – e.g. you can drag a new routed network onto a blueprint and it will automatically create a new Logical Switch and Distributed Logical Router to attach the Logical Switch to. Similarly load balancing applications is a drag and drop operation, as is applying existing security groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All blueprints can be imported and exported in YAML, which opens up exciting possibilities for storing versioned blueprints and retrieving programmatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are over 60 lifecycle events out of the box on which you can trigger Orchestrator workflows, but you can create custom filters based on properties and events to extend functionality – the only limitation is what you can imagine!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still several months of development to go between now and the GA of vRA 7 and the development seems to be moving at a great pace. Between beta 1 and beta 2 there was a huge amount of change, and even the version demoed today had new features and UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015 – Day 2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-day-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 06:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-day-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The first full day of VMworld after PEX was a busy one.&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/10/vmworld2015-logo1.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bits I will cover briefly in this post are..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrading from 6.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPO functionality&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have the guys at VMware added? I have listed what I consider the hi-lights below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maximum of 8 nodes has been doubled to 16!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSO integration has been added (requires vSphere 6.0)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As vROps is still fairly new in comparative terms to other products like vCOPs and VCE Vision, when planning migrations from vCOPs to vROps it is naturally important to check compatibility and what is required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are doing a greenfield deployment of vROps there is nothing to be concerned about, you simply need the VCE Vision appliance running version 2.6.1-2.6.5 and have the latest Management Pack installed on your vROps cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deploying fully distributed vRealize Automation IaaS components – Part 2: Database, Web and Manager services</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/deploying-fully-distributed-vrealize-automation-iaas-components-part-2-database-web-and-manager-services/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 14:40:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/deploying-fully-distributed-vrealize-automation-iaas-components-part-2-database-web-and-manager-services/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/07/vRA-Product-Icon-Mac_0.png" alt=""&gt;Now that the prerequisites for the IaaS layer have been completed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on to the actual installation of the IaaS components, starting with the database.

Instead the recommended layout is shown in the diagram below. One instance of postgres on the primary node becomes an active instance, replicating to the second node which is passive. In front of these a load balancer or DNS entry points to the active node only.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m developing some very large, very complicated workflows for vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO), and as it&amp;rsquo;s a Java based application it will probably come as no surprise to many that the performance of the client drops off sharply as the client&amp;rsquo;s RAM usage creeps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on some of the larger workflows, or after long sessions and heavy clipboard use, the client would become (even more) sluggish and in some cases would freeze entirely. This is particularly annoying because the vRO client has a habit of forcing itself on top of other applications - for instance Task Manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation (vRA) Manager Service error</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-automation-vra-manager-service-error/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2015 10:07:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-automation-vra-manager-service-error/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I wanted to be able to chose whether special characters were used, and the length of the password - typically if the password doesn&amp;rsquo;t used special characters I would increase the length significantly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters should be randomly picked from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a-z&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A-Z&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; is crucial, you *have* to know all areas covered there. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading the &lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/NSX-6/index.jsp#com.vmware.nsx.install.doc/GUID-D8578F6E-A40C-493A-9B43-877C2B75ED52.html" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; documentation
&lt;/a&gt; and design and deploy guides published by VMware, and completed the basic and advanced &lt;a href="http://www.projectnee.com/HOL/catalogs/" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit of a rocky start (missed my flight and the partner day due to tendonitis in my knee) I arrived in Barcelona for my 2nd VMworld Europe. I headed straight from the airport to the PernixData party and caught up with the rest of the Xtravirt guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning started as ever with a keynote address. It was a little disappointing, but not unexpected, that there were no real announcements or reveals in the keynote. It was essentially a repeat of the VMworld US keynote with a couple of new betas announced. Nothing really revolutionary, a new vCloud Air datacenter in Germany and some new partners for EVO:RAIL. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see that the pace of traction for both cloud and hyperconverged is increasing for VMware&amp;rsquo;s portfolio though.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vCAC 6.1 build out to distributed model: Clustered vCAC Appliances</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/09/vcac-6-1-build-out-to-distributed-model-clustered-vcac-appliances/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2014 10:56:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/09/vcac-6-1-build-out-to-distributed-model-clustered-vcac-appliances/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;With the release of vCAC 6.1 there have been some great improvements in the setup of the clustered vCAC appliances - none of the previous copying of configuration files between appliances - just a simple wizard to do it all for you.

&lt;p&gt;When you do uninstall and remove PernixData from your hosts your Path Selection Polices do not revert back to your original configuration rather they revert back to the default vSphere setting of MRU (Most recently used).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Extending a vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) Workflow with ForEach &amp;ndash; Backing up all ESXi hosts in a Cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/extending-a-vcenter-orchestrator-vco-workflow-with-foreach-backing-up-all-esxi-hosts-in-a-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 12:38:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/extending-a-vcenter-orchestrator-vco-workflow-with-foreach-backing-up-all-esxi-hosts-in-a-cluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In my previous post &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/?p=4262" target="_blank"&gt;

If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SRM Authentication&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). Where the process fails is during the “configure connection” stage, if either one of your vCenter servers does not have CA signed and the other does (throws an error that they are using different authentication methods) or that you are using self-signed certificates for either SRM installation (throws an error that the certificate or CA could not be trusted).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCSA 5.5 Web Client fails to log on with &amp;ldquo;SSL certificate verification failed&amp;rdquo;</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This had me scratching my head, what seemed to be a common problem wasn’t fixed by the common solution.

&lt;p&gt;The first solution is to modify the password expiration policy for SSO. I’m not advocating this necessarily – I think that expiring passwords ensure that you change them regularly and increase the overall security of your SSO solution. However, I can envisage situations (similar to mine) when the SSO administrator account is not used for a long time and expired – that causes headaches.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SSO Admin password reset with ssopass – SslHandshakeFailed – vSphere 5.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/11/sso-admin-password-reset-with-ssopass-sslhandshakefailed-vsphere-5-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2013 12:53:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/11/sso-admin-password-reset-with-ssopass-sslhandshakefailed-vsphere-5-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Today I found out that in vSphere 5.1 the SSO administrator account (admin@system-domain) has a password that expires after 365 days.

&lt;p&gt;In vSphere 5.5 it gets even better – the password expires every 90 days by default!

VMware recommend it is disabled. With SSH disabled there is no possibility of attack, so that’s the “most secure” option. Of course in the real world there’s a balance between “most secure” and “usability” (e.g. the most secure host is powered off and physically isolated from the network, but you can’t run any workloads &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;).

&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to join an ESXi host to an Active Directory domain? Well you’re not going to get Group Policies applying, what you’re really doing is adding another authentication provider directly to the ESXi host. You will see a computer object created in AD, but you will still need to create a DNS entry (or configure DHCP to do it for you). What you will get is a way to audit root access to your hosts, to give administrators a single sign on for managing all aspects of your virtual environment and more options in your administrative arsenal – for example, if you’re using an AD group to manage host root access, you don’t have to log onto however many ESXi hosts you have to remove a user’s permissions, simply remove them from the group. You can keep your root passwords in a sealed envelope for emergencies! 😉&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Security: Understanding ESXi 5.x Lockdown Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/vsphere-security-understanding-esxi-5-x-lockdown-mode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 10:05:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/vsphere-security-understanding-esxi-5-x-lockdown-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;This is the first article in a series of vSphere Security articles that I have planned.

There are down sides – it can only take 16GB RAM, only one mSATA disk and only has one gigabit NIC. I don’t think any of those are too big a deal for a personal lab though – certainly I’ve not had any problems building and testing VMware products on my single NUC. I’d drop in an 8GB stick of RAM and an Intel 60GB mSATA SSD per NUC – you could always go 16GB later by adding another 8GB stick in the 2nd slot. I picked the Intel mSATA disk for it’s controller and throughput figures – there are larger and cheaper ones but not with the same write performance. Since the use of SSD is massively in focus with vFlash, PernixData FVP and several other technologies, you wouldn’t want to miss out.

Meeting in Bristol at the crossroads to the South West, The West Country, South Wales and the Midlands, meetings will begin early in 2014, to bring together virtualization customers, end users and enthusiasts in an informal social setting for discussion, learning and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere 5.5 – what I like from what’s new..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/vsphere-5-5-what-i-like-from-whats-new/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2013 16:17:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/vsphere-5-5-what-i-like-from-whats-new/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With vSphere 5.5 being announced at VMworld San Francisco I was very eager to see what was new and after devouring all of the great blog posts out there of the guys in attendance I wanted to summarize in my own way the aspects I think are great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**VMDK 2TB limitation removed! (also virtual mode RDMs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;** This has to be one of the best pieces of news as it has been in the rear trying to accommodate really large VMs (changes affect both VMFS and NFS)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCAP5-DCA &amp;ndash; Achievement Unlocked!

&lt;/a&gt; (and 3 weeks of waking up to check my phone for the email all night) I am pleased to say that I received my Exam Score last week and it was a pass! I was really pleased to see that I passed with a  very decent margin too, which was great! The rushed nature of the exam and long wait for the results leaves you going over the exam in your head convincing yourself how badly you’ve done, so it came as a huge relief and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PowerCLI &amp;ndash; Warning!

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the screenshot below that when I create a Virtual Switch without the parameter, it creates it with 64 ports. Once you minus the 8 reserved for physical NIC ports (uplinks), CDP traffic, and network discovery it leaves you with 56 ports available for VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Design Pocketbook Contributor</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-design-pocketbook-contributor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 13:44:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-design-pocketbook-contributor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note to say that I made it in to a recent book release as a contributor and naturally I am delighted and proud!&lt;/p&gt;

One thing I found when I started preparing is that there is an overwhelming volume of information - the Exam Blueprint is a great place to start as that lays out what will be tested. There are 9 sections and 27 objectives laid out, with knowledge, skills and abilities and tools required for each objective.

&lt;p&gt;VMware products have featured very high on my to-do list so far this year, with new hosting and DR solutions either completed or well underway. The simplicity, resilience and strength of vSphere never gets old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also had the privilege to attend several London VMUG meetings all of which have been excellent!

The solution is to use UMDS to download the updates to a 2nd server that was hosted in the DMZ and then update the vCenter Server from there. It also can save on bandwidth if you’re running multiple vCenter Servers, which again was the case (though bandwidth isn’t really a constraint).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Changing ESXi root passwords the smart way (via PowerCLI)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/changing-esxi-root-passwords-the-smart-way-via-powercli/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 15:08:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/changing-esxi-root-passwords-the-smart-way-via-powercli/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;If you work in company with strict password compliance rules, for example under SOX, you might well have to change administrator passwords every month.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, each service requires a certificate because it could feasibly be on a server (or servers) of it&amp;rsquo;s own - take this hypothetical design - each role is hosted on it&amp;rsquo;s own VM, and there are 7 certificates required - SSO, Inventory Service, vCenter Server, Orchestrator, Web Client, Log Browser and Update Manager. If you install all these services on one server you still have to create certificates for those individual services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Updating ESXi Fibre Channel HBA Drivers via VMware Update Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 14:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware2.jpg" alt=""&gt;A problem reared it&amp;rsquo;s head over the weekend with one of our hosts&amp;rsquo; Fibre Channel HBAs negotiating it&amp;rsquo;s way down to 2GB, and consequently introducing massive latency for the LUNs behind it.

The reason for the 3 vCenter servers was segregation of LAN and DMZ networks: vCenter001 was in the LAN, vCenter002 sat in DMZ1 and vCenter003 sat in DMZ2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fixing the – the server fault invalidargument had no message – error message</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/fixing-the-the-server-fault-invalidargument-had-no-message-error-message/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 10:55:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/fixing-the-the-server-fault-invalidargument-had-no-message-error-message/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;Today while creating new VMs from a template I got the error &amp;ldquo;the server fault invalidargument had no message&amp;rdquo; when editing the VM settings, the settings were modified successfully but the error was present whether a change had been made or not to the settings of the VM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging around on google the error seemed to be related to over-allocating vCPUs (e.g. assigning 8 vCPUs on a VM with 4 physical CPU cores). This was a single vCPU machine on a 12 processor host, so not likely to be that! It did give me the idea that maybe the VMX had an error, so I edited the VM hardware and added an extra CPU and saved the config. I then edited it back to a single CPU and powered on the machine - it worked!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing the VMware Support Assistant</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/01/installing-the-vmware-support-assistant/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2013 14:25:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/01/installing-the-vmware-support-assistant/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;So VMware&amp;rsquo;s Support Assistant is pretty awesome and it&amp;rsquo;s free!

&lt;p&gt;Without wishing to bore the pants off of any would be reader I shall summarize my ruminations as someone whom is still quite new to the VMware world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is a a couple of recent meetings I have had with VMware. Learning that they are now very keen to engage with &amp;rsquo;the rest of us&amp;rsquo; and by that I mean those of us working in SME&amp;rsquo;s as we represent well over 50% of their business revenue. For me personally this was excellent news as we have already invested heavily into the VMware product range and plan to carry on doing so in the future. The recent release of VMware suites was a good step forward but I still feel they need to do a lot better in communicating to SME&amp;rsquo;s about their vast (and ever increasing) product range as there are many gems that can often go unoticed. Our discovery of vCops earlier this year was a good example of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vCenter 5.1 Single Sign On Multi-Site error: User credentials are incorrect or empty</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcenter-5-1-single-sign-on-multi-site-error-user-credentials-are-incorrect-or-empty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2012 20:24:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcenter-5-1-single-sign-on-multi-site-error-user-credentials-are-incorrect-or-empty/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;While adding an additional vCenter Server to our Multi-Site Single Sign On instance I encountered a problem as I entered the details of the existing SSO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/11/SingleSignOnMultiSite.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error thrown was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User credentials are incorrect or empty. Provide correct credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/11/ErrorMessage.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours online with VMware support I took a guess at the problem. On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain. The SSO admin account (admin@System-Domain) is a part of that domain and so my guess is that the installer tries to authenticate using &lt;a href="mailto:admin@definit.local"&gt;
 admin@definit.local
&lt;/a&gt; rather than System-Domain, which of course failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCP5 – vSphere 5 Configuration Maximums Quiz in PowerShell</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 16:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/02/powershell.png" alt=""&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning my vSphere 5 config maximums before my upcoming VCP5 exam, so in a supreme effort of procrastination I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a PowerShell quiz script: here it is!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LUNs had been unpresented at the hardware level by the storage team, but had not been unmounted or removed from vCenter. This is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the way to remove storage - let me re-iterate: &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2011/11/best-practice-how-to-correctly-remove-a-lun-from-an-esx-host.html" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; remove storage properly
&lt;/a&gt;.

The &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; are organised into categories to &amp;ldquo;define how the tags can be applied to inventory objects&amp;rdquo;. The easiest way to think of the difference is that custom attributes are &amp;ldquo;free text&amp;rdquo; and the tags are statically defined properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wizard for converting custom attributes to tags, but it can get a bit confusing and is pretty poor - let me explain. We use four custom attributes in my current environment: CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Owner and ServiceType. CreatedBy contains the user ID of the person who created the VM, CreatedOn is the timestamp of when the VM was created, Owner is the Business Unit who own the server and ServiceType is the type of service - e.g. Active Directory, or SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Site to Site VPN Tunnel traffic flow problems</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/site-to-site-vpn-tunnel-traffic-flow-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 10:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/site-to-site-vpn-tunnel-traffic-flow-problems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Firewalls being used – Sonicwall 3500 &amp;amp; Cisco 506e&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Default MP check moved to beneath the Management servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agents in pending states moved to be with the Agent health states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified &amp;ldquo;Unresponsive Agents&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Agents reporting errors&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Management server alerts streamlined&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added top 10 alerts for the last 7 days, and added top alerters for each&lt;/li&gt;

Based on this Microsoft recommend a series of health checks to for the environment that should be carried out every day. This is summarised as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the health of all Management Servers and Gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the RMS is not in maintenance mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Outstanding Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Agent&amp;rsquo;s Health Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Backup Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review any Management Group Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the Pending Management status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Database Sizes (Operations, Data warehouse, ACS)&lt;/li&gt;

As with a lot of Management Packs, to get the most out of it you need to have a dedicated RunAs account with local admin permissions on the servers you are monitoring (e.g. for the Backlogged Files reporting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy (and wrong) option here is to go with the less secure option and distribute a RunAs account to ALL servers. There are lots of reasons why you wouldn’t want to distribute the credentials to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; server in your SCOM installation – but just from a security standpoint, you shouldn’t do it!

&lt;p&gt;Having recently managed several Exchange 2010 migration projects, one of the best new features which really sells it to systems administrators is the Online Archive. “No more managing PST files? When can we have it installed by?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, once they’ve purchased licensing for Exchange 2010 and installed and configured the server, migrated the users’ mailboxes and decommissioned the old Exchange 2003 server, the Online Archive feature is not available. The users have been enabled, and as of SP1 we have a separate Archive mailbox database configured on slow (cheap) storage, but the Online Archive is nowhere to be found in Outlook. If the users log on using OWA, lo and behold the Online Archive is available.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 – CreateTestUser : Mailbox could not be created.

&lt;li&gt;Branding. Whether I like it or not, “McGeown” is not easy to spell or remember so I wanted to move away from it as an identity.

I will introduce those bloggers as and when they arrive, but they will be people I know and trust – with real technical expertise. (That said, if you’re reading and are interested in writing for DefinIT, please contact me!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually I’d like to use McGeown.co.uk for a more personal site, aimed at family and friends. That’s what it was originally aimed at, and hopefully one of these days I’ll get the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to let me know what you think about the new theme, new name and new URL in the comments below. This blog will always be dedicated to providing high quality IT help on a broad range of subjects, as ever, I hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reporting all ActiveSync devices and their Users in Exchange 2010</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/reporting-all-activesync-devices-and-users-in-exchange-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 14:28:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/reporting-all-activesync-devices-and-users-in-exchange-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/02/Exchange-2010-Logo-748516_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;Recently I needed to report on the ActiveSync devices that were attached to our Exchange 2010 organisation, and which users they were accessing, and then export them to a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking through the script it gets all the mailboxes from the server MBX01, gets an object containing the ActiveSync device name, type and user agent. It then adds a property to that object called “MailboxIdentity” and adds it to that object. That object is then added to an array of objects called ActiveSyncDevices, which is then exported to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My password confession: a.k.a sorting out password security with LastPass</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/my-password-confession-a-k-a-sorting-out-password-security-with-lastpass/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2011 17:36:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/my-password-confession-a-k-a-sorting-out-password-security-with-lastpass/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="i-cant-plead-ignorance-i-should-know-better"&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t plead ignorance: I should know better! &lt;a class="anchor" href="#i-cant-plead-ignorance-i-should-know-better"&gt;

It’s pretty simple to install in a domain environment – you run the installer to create a collection server, then activate the forwarder on the client servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to servers you really want to audit, those that are by definition more at risk from security breach because they are publicly accessible, it’s not so straightforward. Take for example that web server, or FTP host in your DMZ, certainly not domain joined and probably bombarded by daily brute force password attacks.

&lt;p&gt;It’s good practice to separate VMotion, virtual machine and iSCSI traffic, it also helps you manage those logical and physical connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect to your ESXi server using the vSphere Client and select the host. Go to the configuration tab and click “Add Networking…”.

&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install the MSI on both ends – for the sake of this, say SERVER1 and SERVER2. Once you’ve installed it on the server, navigate to \Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\NT Testing TCP Tool, you should see a few copies of the tool for different architectures. Locate the correct .exe for you architecture and rename it to ntttcps.exe.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you are using Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have a Microsoft Certificate Services 2003 Certificate Authority on your domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you have non-domain Windows Server 2008 servers you wish to monitor or set up as a gateway server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting a certificate for either a Gateway Server or remotely monitored Server can be a touch vexing. If you’re installing on the same domain as the SCOM management server the security settings take care of themselves, not so for non-domain servers, which require mutual certificate authentication. The Gateway must trust the Domain CA and identify itself as trusted to the Management Server. I have bashed my head against this several times now, so I thought I’d make a precise blog post to cover the steps required!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 “New Local Move Request” and “New Remote Move Request” missing when you right-click a user’s MailBox</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/exchange-2010-%E2%80%9Cnew-local-move-request%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cnew-remote-move-request%E2%80%9D-missing-when-you-right-click-a-user%E2%80%99s-mailbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 12:14:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/exchange-2010-%E2%80%9Cnew-local-move-request%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cnew-remote-move-request%E2%80%9D-missing-when-you-right-click-a-user%E2%80%99s-mailbox/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’m currently testing an Exchange 2010 server for the organisation prior to a migration project, specifically testing moving mailboxes backwards and forwards.

&lt;p&gt;I spend perhaps 8 hours a day at my work PC, maybe 2 hours a day on my home laptop and my iPhone is with me pretty much 24/7 – all of which are both data sources, and data endpoints. They all remind me to do things.

I&amp;rsquo;m pretty comfortable with the Cisco IOS, but I still prefer the GUI for the basic set up, using command line to tweak the finer or more complex configurations. However, straight out of the box, I had a very hard time getting the ASDM to load. Being familiar with the PDM from the PIX range of firewalls, I should have guessed the problem straight away. Essentially, whatever problem you&amp;rsquo;re having with the ASDM, whether it&amp;rsquo;s not loading, not reading the configuration or whatever, the answer is likely to be &amp;ldquo;uninstall your current version of Java, google java 1.4.2, install it, try again&amp;rdquo;.

All our domain users have a userfolder on the server, it’s mapped as z:\ and there is a folder redirection set up. It’s pretty standard in a corporate/domain environment, so why does it cause so many Vista installations to fail?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;rsquo;re using UAC (User Account Control) you might need to map the network drive as the administrator. This is a pain in the @$$ because you have to disconnect the drive under your user account first. Of course, if you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve got ANY documents open, this will upset your profile. Anyway, steps for that: &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Disconnect the currently mapped drive. &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Open the command prompt as the administrator. Type &amp;quot;net use \\[server]\share and check that it&amp;amp;rsquo;s mapped by typing &amp;amp;ldquo;net use&amp;amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
 
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Open explorer and navigate to your shared folder and right click, use the &amp;amp;ldquo;Map Network Drive&amp;amp;rdquo; wizard to map the share under your user profile. &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;If all above fails (as in my case), your only option is to log in as a user that doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t map drives (machine local admin works for me, but then you have to enable that user as it&amp;amp;rsquo;s disabled by default. You also have to provide a password for it - don&amp;amp;rsquo;t forget to disable again after an install.)&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

 &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

When installing the SP1 I was elevating my standard user credential rather than running as the domain admin.
