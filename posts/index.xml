Virtual conference event fatigue is real. I have attended and presented at many since the pandemic began, with varying levels of engagement. As an introvert, I can&amp;rsquo;t quite believe I&amp;rsquo;m saying this, but I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get pack to meeting up with people in the real world!
The value of a conference is super-charged by the mix of dedicated time, networking opportunities and quality live content.</description></item><item><title>Workaround: Adding an external vRealize Orchestrator 8.x instance to Code Stream</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/workaround-adding-an-external-vrealize-orchestrator-8.x-instance-to-code-stream/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/workaround-adding-an-external-vrealize-orchestrator-8.x-instance-to-code-stream/</guid><description>I was doing some testing with adding an external vRealize Orchestrator 8.4 endpoint to vRealize Automation Code Stream 8.4, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a redirect that happens with the vRO 8.4 appliance that makes the endpoint validation fail.

Master Services Competencies (MSCs) are VMware partner designations designed to recognize services-capable partners with delivery expertise and experience within a VMware solution area.
With that in mind I sat the VCF Specialist exam.
The Exam The exam covers a broad spectrum of VMware technologies (vSphere, NSX-T, vSAN, Tanzu) I was apprehensive about it as there is an awful lot of material to cover that the exam expects you to have good knowledge of.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Operations 8.4 - What's New</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/04/vrealize-operations-8.4-whats-new/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/04/vrealize-operations-8.4-whats-new/</guid><description>There has been some really exciting things being announced/relased by VMware and their respective product teams recently so lets take a look at all the new goodness in vRealize Operations 8.4

However, applications being applications, sometimes they become less responsive than they should (or for example, when my Synology updates itself and reboots, any mounted NFS volumes can cause the running pods to degrade in performance). This isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue with service liveliness, which can be mitigated with a liveness probe that restarts the pod if a service isn&amp;rsquo;t running.</description></item><item><title>Integrating vROps with vRA 8 using Workspace One Auth Source</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/03/integrating-vrops-with-vra-8-using-workspace-one-auth-source/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/03/integrating-vrops-with-vra-8-using-workspace-one-auth-source/</guid><description>Integrating vROps with vRA 8 using Workspace One Auth Source Product Version - vRealize Automation 8.x Why integrate vROps with vRA 8? vRealize Automation can work with vRealize Operations Manager to perform advanced workload placement, provide deployment health and virtual machine metrics, and display pricing.

The workflow itself is pretty self explanatory, with my deployment action, which returns a VC:Task, and the standard “wait for a task to end” action.</description></item><item><title>Things we can look forward to seeing in #vROps 7.0</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/09/things-we-can-look-forward-to-seeing-in-vrops-7-0/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2018 11:51:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/09/things-we-can-look-forward-to-seeing-in-vrops-7-0/</guid><description>I did a quick search online and could not find a collated list so, by way of a quick summary from all the VMworld 2018 announcements and comments my good friend and PM for vRealize Operations Sunny Dua has made, I have collated a list of what we can expect to see in the next iteration of vROps (7.0).

I am sure if you ask that question to ten people you will get 10 different answers, or at the very least a wide variety of reasons. The product chosen to deliver the solution was a poor match, the product was implemented incorrectly, the PM sucked, the Vendor gave no support, insufficient training material/resources, poor interoperability, the list goes on and on.
One issue I have observed from time to time on my travels is quite different from the above listed examples.</description></item><item><title>Simon’s #VMworld 2017: Wednesday</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/simons-vmworld-day-4-wednesday/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Sep 2017 17:30:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/simons-vmworld-day-4-wednesday/</guid><description>This was as I expected, the busiest day sessions wise for me.

While we all know that, automating day to day operations tasks is becoming the choice of an IT organization, it is hard for them to find a solution which can completely understand their business policies and provide them the efficiency they need from automating simple operational tasks.
Based on our research, we found that, one of the most time consuming activity done by an Virtual Infrastructure Administrator is to juggle resources between the changing business requirements and ensure that every VM which is being hosted in their environment is BEING SERVED WELL.</description></item><item><title>Looking forward to #VMworld EMEA 2017</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/looking-forward-to-vmworld-emea-2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 09:30:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/looking-forward-to-vmworld-emea-2017/</guid><description>Having missed last years VMworld I feel very ready for attending the EMEA VMworld in Barcelona.

The diagram below shows the architecture of the solution.
Deploying vCHA can be done in two modes - &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;. You can use Basic mode if the vCenter you want to be HA is managing the hosts it resides on - in this scenario the wizard configures your vCenter and deploys the Passive and Witness nodes for you.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 2- Full Stack monitoring with vRealize Operations Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/05/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-2-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2017 07:18:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/05/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-2-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</guid><description>[&amp;lt;img class=&amp;ldquo;alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-8035&amp;rdquo; src=&amp;quot;/images/2017/03/logo.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; width=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;150&amp;rdquo; which vROps can provide by using various extensibility solutions.

HA is a great feature and in my opinion should be considered seriously with any deployment (where possible).
Not only does HA protect your Master node (which essentially behaves as an index for your vROps cluster and if lost will render your cluster dead unless you have a working backup of your cluster) it will also allow your cluster to tolerate a data node failure.</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.5 – Two new enhancements/features I really liked</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 08:37:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</guid><description>So vROps 6.5 has been out for around a month now and I finally have a little while to write a post on what I personally really like.
There is a lot of great new enhancements and improvements added in 6.5 but for the sake of brevity I shall highlight two that I really liked.

I have lost count of the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to help troubleshoot an issue that, when asked, people don&amp;rsquo;t know which log they should be looking at. The simple fact is that vRealize Automation has a lot of log files. Correlating these log sources to provide an overall picture is a painful, manual process - unless you have Log Insight!</description></item><item><title>The Speed of Change in IT Infrastructure (Opinion)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/the-speed-of-change-in-it-infrastructure-opinion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2017 09:34:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/the-speed-of-change-in-it-infrastructure-opinion/</guid><description>Over the past 6 months I have been dwelling more and more on the obvious speed of change and development in IT Infrastructure. What do I mean? Well each year there is the new hotness, the next thing/innovation you are told you need or should have.
In most cases the innovations and new tech are ground breaking awesomeness and most certainly offer new opportunities for the infrastructure masses.
I am all for progress, if you are not moving forward and regularly looking for sensible ways to improve what you do and the infrastructure you use then I really do think you are in the wrong industry.</description></item><item><title>Lab notes: Upgrading vSphere 6.0 and NSX 6.2 to vSphere 6.5a and NSX 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:07:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding off upgrading my lab to vSphere 6.5 because NSX 6.2.x doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it. With the release of NSX 6.3 and vSphere 6.5a, I can now upgrade.
The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator Workflow: shutdownVSANCluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</guid><description>My vSphere lab is split into two halves - a low power management cluster, powered by 3 Intel NUCs, and a more hefty workload cluster powered by a Dell C6100 chassis with 3 nodes. The workload servers are noisy and power hungry so they tend to be powered off when I am not using them, and since they live in my garage, I power them on and off remotely.
To automate the process, I wanted to write an Orchestrator workflow (vRO sits on my management cluster and is therefore always on) that could safely and robustly shut down the workload cluster.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Part 12 : What’s New with vROps 6.4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vrops-webinar-2016-part-12-whats-new-with-vrops-6-4/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2016 12:02:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vrops-webinar-2016-part-12-whats-new-with-vrops-6-4/</guid><description>Time to publish the recording for the 12th episode of the vROps Webinar Series.

Note that none of this is official or supported by VMware as far as I know - it&amp;rsquo;s the results of my experimentation which has shown some performance improvement by increasing the configured memory pool.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 12 : What’s New with vROps 6.4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-12-whats-new-with-vrops-6-4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2016 08:36:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-12-whats-new-with-vrops-6-4/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s the time of the month when I would like to invite you to join the next episode of our year long vROps Webinar Series.

This time around, Sunny and I thought about discussing Architecture of vROps. To some, it might sound strange as for smaller deployments you might not have to worry about Sizing and Architecture much since it is pretty simple to install and configure a small or a medium node for a small shop. However as your monitoring needs grow and you start adding solutions for monitoring data sources beyond vSphere, you would need to think about scaling up or scaling out.</description></item><item><title>Log Insight services not starting after cluster IP changes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/log-insight-services-not-starting-after-cluster-ip-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2016 15:26:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/log-insight-services-not-starting-after-cluster-ip-changes/</guid><description>I ran into this problem at a customer site where all the Log Insight nodes were changed due to some IP address conflicts.

The symptoms:
The web interface was down, a netstat -ano | grep -i “443” showed the service was listening _service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes /var/log/loginsight/runtime.</description></item><item><title>What if I want full metrics? in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</guid><description>If you have used vCOps (previous version of vROPs) you will likely remember the option in the admin panel where you could change the number of metrics being collected from &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo;.
As many found, this option drop down was not present in vROps and there appeared to be no replacement.
Here is the good news, the ability to collect those metrics has not been removed rather it&amp;rsquo;s just a little more hidden (by design)</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 : Part 4 – Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 08:17:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>As promised, I am posting the recording for the 4th Session of vROps Webinar Series 2016.

However what if you want to scale up your node or nodes, going from say small to medium?
Reasons why?
Perhaps your POC has proved so useful you want to move it into production? You have lots of really useful historical on your existing smaller build and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to redeploy (therefore losing your historical data) You have limitations where scaling out is simply not an option but you need vROps to take on more work.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 4 : Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 11:33:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>We hope you are having fun with the vROps Webinar Series and learning in the process!

Capacity Planning is an integral part of vRealize Operations Manager and through this session we want to de-mystify the concepts of Capacity Planning in vROps using features such as projects and the out-of-box capacity views. We will also look at defining the capacity planning policies based on the business requirements of an organization &amp; yeah this would be all done through LIVE DEMOS 🙂 Day &amp; Date : Thursday, 24th Mar 2016</description></item><item><title>Is there any #vROps reference architecture?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/is-there-any-vrops-reference-architecture/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2016 12:17:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/is-there-any-vrops-reference-architecture/</guid><description>Given the flexibility in which you can choose to use and deploy vROps a question that frequently comes out is “is there a best practice?”
While that phrase is getting pretty tired it is still valid if you are just starting a design for a new vROps build or trying to make the best of a bad implementation. Rather than me trying to tell you how you should use vROps in your place of work I would direct you to a very useful PDF VMware have produced vRealize Operations Manager Reference Architecture.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 7 Custom Hostname with Event Broker (EB) Subscription</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/vrealize-automation-7-custom-hostname-with-event-broker-eb-subscription/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2016 17:54:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/vrealize-automation-7-custom-hostname-with-event-broker-eb-subscription/</guid><description>The new Event Broker service in vRA7 is one of the most exciting features of this latest release, the possibilities for extensibility are huge. At this point it time you can still use the old method of using workflow stubs to customise machine lifecycle events, but at some point in the future this will be deprecated and the Event Broker will be the only way to extend.
With this in mind, I wanted to use the Event Broker to do something that I am asked on almost every customer engagement - custom hostnames beyond what the Machine Prefixes mechanism can do.</description></item><item><title>Can I secure #vROps?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/can-i-secure-vrops/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 13:42:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/can-i-secure-vrops/</guid><description>Those of you used to using vSphere on a regular basis will already be aware of the hardening guide for ESXi and vSphere but what about vROps?

What is a Policy??
&amp;ldquo;A policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol&amp;rdquo;

While the role of vRealize Operations Manager is to help you with Performance &amp;amp; Capacity Management of your Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC), it is important that you feed in the guiding principles of your Business Environment into vROps to get the rational outcomes.</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.2 – upgrade and utilization dashboards</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:25:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</guid><description>As you will see the upgrade is simple and even though its early days I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything that has been broken!

What has become a consistent theme in all the stories is just how much compute resources vROps requires when you “go big” and not just what is clearly defined in the sizing spreadsheet.
For example some of the large deployments I have either been involved in or heard about (to monitor upwards and beyond of 30000 VMs) required the deployment of Large vROps nodes.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Operations Webinar Series : 2015 :Part 1 : Building Self Healing Environments with #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrealize-operations-webinar-series-2015-part-1-building-self-healing-environments-with-vrops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2016 10:20:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrealize-operations-webinar-series-2015-part-1-building-self-healing-environments-with-vrops/</guid><description>A series of webcasts on vRealize Operations Manager 6.x, helping you learn about anything and everything about the solution.

8 nodes if you are on versions 6.0.x 16 nodes if you are on version 6.1 Why does this matter if you plan to use SNMP with your vROps cluster?

Select the &amp;ldquo;Special Parameters&amp;rdquo; tab and configure the send string to the URL to monitor - e.g for the PSC SSO it&amp;rsquo;s going to be:
GET /websso/HealthStatus For the receive string, enter the expected response (&amp;ldquo;GREEN&amp;rdquo;). Click Create.
Assigning a NetScaler Monitor to a Service Assign the monitor to the PSC Services (or Service Groups) configured for PSC by opening the Configuration &amp;gt; Traffic Management &amp;gt; Load Balancing &amp;gt; Services page and selecting the PSC service for HTTPS/443 and clicking Edit.</description></item><item><title>VCE Vision, vCOPs to vROps migration</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/vce-vision-vcops-to-vrops-migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 22:26:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/vce-vision-vcops-to-vrops-migration/</guid><description>Recently I have been working with various products that compliment or are accessed by vCOPs/vROps via Management packs.
As vROps is still fairly new in comparative terms to other products like vCOPs and VCE Vision, when planning migrations from vCOPs to vROps it is naturally important to check compatibility and what is required for a successful migration.
If you are doing a greenfield deployment of vROps there is nothing to be concerned about, you simply need the VCE Vision appliance running version 2.</description></item><item><title>Deploying fully distributed vRealize Automation IaaS components – Part 2: Database, Web and Manager services</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/deploying-fully-distributed-vrealize-automation-iaas-components-part-2-database-web-and-manager-services/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 14:40:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/deploying-fully-distributed-vrealize-automation-iaas-components-part-2-database-web-and-manager-services/</guid><description>Now that the prerequisites for the IaaS layer have been completed, it&amp;rsquo;s time to move on to the actual installation of the IaaS components, starting with the database.

Add in 5 more servers, some load balancers, certificates, a distributed setup and MSDTC to the mix and you have a huge potential for pain!
If you&amp;rsquo;ve followed my previous posts, you&amp;rsquo;ll see know that I&amp;rsquo;ve got a HA Platform Services Controller configured, and a HA vRealize Appliance cluster configured with Postgres replication - all good so far.</description></item><item><title>My VCAP5-DCD experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/my-vcap5-dcd-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 08:59:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/my-vcap5-dcd-experience/</guid><description>A few months ago I decided to tackle the VCAP5-DCD exam and when booking I gave myself 2 months to study before the date of the exam.

{com.cmware.cap.component.iaas.proxy.provider@csp.places.iaas.label}
Rebooting the IaaS web servers restored the functionality of the IaaS layer but still did not fix the label issue, it took a further reboot of both vRealize Automation appliances, then the IaaS web servers to finally view the correct labels.</description></item><item><title>Automate changing the vSphere 6 Platform Services Controller IP address (and vRealize Automation)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/automate-changing-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-ip-address/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 15:04:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/automate-changing-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-ip-address/</guid><description>Note: This falls under the “I don’t think this is supported” category – use this method at your own peril!
As part of some testing I’ve been doing for vRealize Automation DR scenarios, I wanted to test changing the IP address of a HA PSC pair using a script (think SRM failover to a new subnet).
What I didn’t want to do was simply edit the connections directly – quite often with the VMware appliances there are scripts on start-up to ensure the configuration is correct and consistent – what I wanted was to be able to find a more supported and reliable way.</description></item><item><title>Resetting the vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller root password</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 13:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how supported this is, but this process can recover a vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller when you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the root password.

Mount the CD to the PSC Appliance
Reboot the appliance and enter the BIOS setup using F2, configure the CD-ROM as first-boot device. Save and exit to reboot into the SUSE Live-CD.
Once the Live-CD has booted to a desktop, you’ll see a 12GB volume at the top – that’s your PSC appliance root.</description></item><item><title>Deploying vRealize Automation 6.2 Appliance Cluster with Postgres Replication</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/deploying-vrealize-automation-6-2-appliance-cluster-with-postgres-replication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2015 19:57:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/deploying-vrealize-automation-6-2-appliance-cluster-with-postgres-replication/</guid><description>The recommendations for the vRealize Appliance have changed with 6.2, the published reference architecture now does not recommend using an external Postgres database (either vPostgres appliance, a 3rd party Postgres deployment or using a third vRealize Appliance as a stand-alone database installation).

The trick is getting the Master Orchestrator node to pick the right proxy workflow.</description></item><item><title>Configuring and Using vRealize Orchestrator (vCO/vRO) Multi-node plugin</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/configuring-and-using-vrealize-orchestrator-vcovro-multi-node-plugin/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2015 16:50:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/configuring-and-using-vrealize-orchestrator-vcovro-multi-node-plugin/</guid><description>To quote the release notes for the latest version of vCO/vRO Multi-node Plugin:
The VMware vCenter Orchestrator Multi-Node Plug-In allows organizations to manage environments with multiple vCenter Orchestrator server instances.
As organizations increase their level of automation, they often find the need to deploy multiple Orchestrator instances. With the VMware vCenter Orchestrator Multi-Node Plug-In, administrators have a more efficient way to manage multiple Orchestrator instances from a central point. The plug-in allows administrators to log in to a master Orchestrator server to view the inventories and workflows of remote Orchestrator servers, and to trigger workflows remotely.</description></item><item><title>Configuring a vRO/vCAC PowerShell host with Basic Authentication</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/12/configuring-a-vrovcac-powershell-host-with-basic-authentication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 15:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/12/configuring-a-vrovcac-powershell-host-with-basic-authentication/</guid><description>To add a Windows Server 2012 R2 PowerShell host using Basic Authentication only, follow these steps.

If like me you use iSCSI then you will likely spend a bit of time setting up your Path Selection Polices to suit your specific needs, so it was interesting to note the following.
When you do uninstall and remove PernixData from your hosts your Path Selection Polices do not revert back to your original configuration rather they revert back to the default vSphere setting of MRU (Most recently used).</description></item><item><title>Extending a vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) Workflow with ForEach &amp;ndash; Backing up all ESXi hosts in a Cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/extending-a-vcenter-orchestrator-vco-workflow-with-foreach-backing-up-all-esxi-hosts-in-a-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Mar 2014 12:38:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/extending-a-vcenter-orchestrator-vco-workflow-with-foreach-backing-up-all-esxi-hosts-in-a-cluster/</guid><description>In my previous post Backing up ESXi 5.5 host configurations with vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) – Workflow design walkthrough I showed how to create a workflow to back up host configurations, but it was limited to one host at a time.

If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see SRM Authentication).</description></item><item><title>VCSA 5.5 Web Client fails to log on with &amp;ldquo;SSL certificate verification failed&amp;rdquo;</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</guid><description>This had me scratching my head, what seemed to be a common problem wasn’t fixed by the common solution.

VMware recommend it is disabled. With SSH disabled there is no possibility of attack, so that’s the “most secure” option. Of course in the real world there’s a balance between “most secure” and “usability” (e.g. the most secure host is powered off and physically isolated from the network, but you can’t run any workloads ).</description></item><item><title>WMworld Europe 2013 – Day 3 and Recap</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/wmworld-europe-2013-day-3-and-recap/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Oct 2013 10:30:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/wmworld-europe-2013-day-3-and-recap/</guid><description>Last night was the VMworld party which was loads of fun, I took some pictures so I won&amp;rsquo;t write loads!

You can see in the screenshot below that when I create a Virtual Switch without the parameter, it creates it with 64 ports. Once you minus the 8 reserved for physical NIC ports (uplinks), CDP traffic, and network discovery it leaves you with 56 ports available for VMs.</description></item><item><title>vSphere Design Pocketbook Contributor</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-design-pocketbook-contributor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Aug 2013 13:44:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-design-pocketbook-contributor/</guid><description>Just a quick note to say that I made it in to a recent book release as a contributor and naturally I am delighted and proud!

Why does it require multiple certificates for my vCenter server? In short, each service requires a certificate because it could feasibly be on a server (or servers) of it&amp;rsquo;s own - take this hypothetical design - each role is hosted on it&amp;rsquo;s own VM, and there are 7 certificates required - SSO, Inventory Service, vCenter Server, Orchestrator, Web Client, Log Browser and Update Manager.</description></item><item><title>Updating ESXi Fibre Channel HBA Drivers via VMware Update Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 14:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</guid><description>A problem reared it&amp;rsquo;s head over the weekend with one of our hosts' Fibre Channel HBAs negotiating it&amp;rsquo;s way down to 2GB, and consequently introducing massive latency for the LUNs behind it.

I had a single-pane-of-glass view of all 3 and I could manage them all from the one client.</description></item><item><title>Fixing the – the server fault invalidargument had no message – error message</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/fixing-the-the-server-fault-invalidargument-had-no-message-error-message/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Feb 2013 10:55:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/fixing-the-the-server-fault-invalidargument-had-no-message-error-message/</guid><description>Today while creating new VMs from a template I got the error &amp;ldquo;the server fault invalidargument had no message&amp;rdquo; when editing the VM settings, the settings were modified successfully but the error was present whether a change had been made or not to the settings of the VM.

Without wishing to bore the pants off of any would be reader I shall summarize my ruminations as someone whom is still quite new to the VMware world.
The first thing that comes to mind is a a couple of recent meetings I have had with VMware. Learning that they are now very keen to engage with &amp;lsquo;the rest of us&amp;rsquo; and by that I mean those of us working in SME&amp;rsquo;s as we represent well over 50% of their business revenue.</description></item><item><title>vCenter 5.1 Single Sign On Multi-Site error: User credentials are incorrect or empty</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcenter-5-1-single-sign-on-multi-site-error-user-credentials-are-incorrect-or-empty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2012 20:24:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcenter-5-1-single-sign-on-multi-site-error-user-credentials-are-incorrect-or-empty/</guid><description>While adding an additional vCenter Server to our Multi-Site Single Sign On instance I encountered a problem as I entered the details of the existing SSO.
The error thrown was:
User credentials are incorrect or empty. Provide correct credentials.
After a couple of hours online with VMware support I took a guess at the problem. On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain.</description></item><item><title>VCP5 – vSphere 5 Configuration Maximums Quiz in PowerShell</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 16:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning my vSphere 5 config maximums before my upcoming VCP5 exam, so in a supreme effort of procrastination I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a PowerShell quiz script: here it is!

It&amp;rsquo;s repetitive and easy to make a mistake on any step of the way. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve got to do this for quite a few VirtualCenter Servers, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d script the certificate generation if nothing else. I am following the excellent documentation provided in Implementing CA signed SSL certificates with vSphere 5.1 and more specifically in Creating certificate requests and certificates for vCenter Server 5.</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware vSphere Single Sign On (SSO) in Multi-site Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/installing-vmware-vsphere-single-sign-on-sso-in-multi-site-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 19:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/installing-vmware-vsphere-single-sign-on-sso-in-multi-site-mode/</guid><description>VMware vSphere Single Sign On (SSO) can be installed in Multi-site mode to support local sign-on to vCenters that you want to be part of the same single sign on domain - for example, if you want to install Linked-Mode and have the advantage of a single pane of glass view, but can&amp;rsquo;t risk using a single SSO instance across the WAN. In other words, from VMware&amp;rsquo;s blog post:
Multisite deployments are where a local replica is maintained at remote sites of the primary vCenter Single Sign-On instance.</description></item><item><title>DataStore conflicts with an existing DataStore in the DataCenter – Manually disabling Storage I/O Control</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 15:31:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</guid><description>I ran into this issue yesterday while reconnecting hosts in our vCenter Server following a complete reinstall - the reasons for which are a long story, but suffice to say that there were new certificates and the host passwords were encrypted with the old ones.
The LUNs had been unpresented at the hardware level by the storage team, but had not been unmounted or removed from vCenter. This is not the way to remove storage - let me re-iterate: remove storage properly.</description></item><item><title>Host disk write latency errors – troubleshooting</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2012 11:02:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting/</guid><description>So recently we upgraded our cluster monitoring suite to it&amp;rsquo;s latest iteration (Veeam ONE), it was not long before I began to receive emails from the monitor informing me of Host disk write latency &amp;ldquo;errors&amp;rdquo; (Datastore write latency had exceeded the defined threshold in the monitor) on several of the Datastores on our SAN.

The &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; are organised into categories to &amp;ldquo;define how the tags can be applied to inventory objects&amp;rdquo;. The easiest way to think of the difference is that custom attributes are &amp;ldquo;free text&amp;rdquo; and the tags are statically defined properties.
There is a wizard for converting custom attributes to tags, but it can get a bit confusing and is pretty poor - let me explain.</description></item><item><title>Site to Site VPN Tunnel traffic flow problems</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/site-to-site-vpn-tunnel-traffic-flow-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 10:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/site-to-site-vpn-tunnel-traffic-flow-problems/</guid><description>Firewalls being used – Sonicwall 3500 &amp;amp; Cisco 506e

I added a new NIC to each VM and configured the IP addressing, VLANs and routing, but could not get the intra-array network to ping, let alone talk to each other.</description></item><item><title>Installing and Configuring OTRS 3.0.9 on Windows Server 2008 R2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:02:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</guid><description>OTRS is an exceptionally flexible ITIL compliant ticketing/helpdesk solution, which runs beautifully on almost any LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl (yes, I know it’s PHP really;-)) server, but what happens when you work in a Windows-only environment?

Installing as components allows you to upgrade portions of the system and have more granular control over the setup.</description></item><item><title>Configuring a Guest wireless network with restricted access to Production VLANs</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/configuring-guest-wireless-network-restricted-access-production-vlans/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 16:42:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/configuring-guest-wireless-network-restricted-access-production-vlans/</guid><description>It’s a fairly common requirement – setting up a guest WiFi network that is secure from the rest of your LAN. You need a secure WLAN access for the domain laptops which has full access to the Server and Client VLANs, but you also need a guest WLAN for visitors to the office which only allows internet access. Since the budget is limited, this must all be accomplished via a single Access Point – for this article, the access point is a Cisco WAP4410N.</description></item><item><title>A work/learn balance</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/a-worklearn-balance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 10:50:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/a-worklearn-balance/</guid><description>As with all things IT the pace of technology change is relentless and we are constantly and rightly told that change is good and that being able to evolve and move with the times is an important skill and ability.

It’s good practice to separate VMotion, virtual machine and iSCSI traffic, it also helps you manage those logical and physical connections.
Connect to your ESXi server using the vSphere Client and select the host.

One of the major drivers for me as a “Microsoft” person was to use something that is based on Microsoft technology – BlogEngine.Net is based (as the name suggests) on the .Net framework. I’m much happier these days writing limited amounts of C#.Net than I am with PHP.</description></item><item><title>Testing access to your Exchange services with Microsoft Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/testing-access-to-your-exchange-services-with-microsoft-exchange-remote-connectivity-analyzer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 09:27:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/testing-access-to-your-exchange-services-with-microsoft-exchange-remote-connectivity-analyzer/</guid><description>The Microsoft Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer is perhaps the best tool I’ve used in a long time for troubleshooting Exchange external access – it just works!

The environment is a single AD domain with 4 sites, Site1, Site2, Site3 and Site4. In Site1, Site2 and Site3 there are 3 Exchange 2003 servers, one per site. In Site4 there is an Exchange 2007 SP2 server (CAS, Mailbox, HT). All the connectors required worked as expected, and inter-site routing works as expected.
I introduced into the mix a 2010 Enterprise server (CAS, Mailbox, HT) to Site1 as a prelude to a full upgrade of the site to Exchange 2010.</description></item><item><title>Exchange ActiveSync fails on iPhone after upgrade to iOS4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 15:55:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</guid><description>I’ve spent a fair bit of time today trying to sort out my iPhone sync to my Exchange Server, failing miserably.

Stage 3 is the upgrade of the Virtual Machines to the latest VMware Tools and then the new VM hardware.</description></item><item><title>MOSS 2007 – Alternate Access Mapping authentication fails</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/moss-2007-%E2%80%93-alternate-access-mapping-authentication-fails/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2009 14:58:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/moss-2007-%E2%80%93-alternate-access-mapping-authentication-fails/</guid><description>If you have an Alternate Access Mapping configured for a MOSS 2007 site with Integrated Authentication you might find that you get prompted for the DOMAIN\UserName and Password.

If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to move a 2nd, 3rd or nth disk and you get this error, drag the entire VM as per above over to the new Datastore, once that&amp;rsquo;s completed, go back in to SVMotion and drag the whole VM across again, only this time before you apply, drag the nth disk back to the new Datastore.</description></item><item><title>ESX 3.5 snapshots of disks on different storage are stored with the VM files</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/esx-3-5-snapshots-of-disks-on-different-storage-are-stored-with-the-vm-files/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2009 16:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/esx-3-5-snapshots-of-disks-on-different-storage-are-stored-with-the-vm-files/</guid><description>A.K.A Why not to use snapshots I ran into a slightly confusing problem today - our SQL servers are all created with 4 disks on 4 separate LUNs (System, Swap, SQL Data and SQL Logs).

So a big email comes in; lets say it&amp;rsquo;s 8MB. Your Exchange 2003 server, set to it&amp;rsquo;s defaults for size restrictions, rejects the email. Why?

We have bonded ADSL because our exchange still doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SDSL, and a leased line is overkill. Theoretically, we should have 28.1 Mbps download and 3.2Mbps upload - what I am actually seeing is about 1.7Mbps down and 1.9Mbps up. I have tested this on various servers, over various times and file sizes, there is no doubt that the performance is POOR.</description></item><item><title>Outlook Web Access over SSL using Forms Based Authentication AND Integrated Authentication</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/outlook-web-access-over-ssl-using-forms-based-authentication-and-integrated-authentication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jul 2008 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/outlook-web-access-over-ssl-using-forms-based-authentication-and-integrated-authentication/</guid><description>Outlook Web access is a fantastic tool for our company, providing on-the-go
