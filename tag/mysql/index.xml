The simple answer is that I used to make something up as I went along, deploying components by hand and generally repeating myself a lot. I had some cut/paste commands in my note application that sped things up a little, but nothing that developed. I’ve been meaning to rectify this for a while, and this is the result!</description></item><item><title>Installing and Configuring OTRS 3.0.9 on Windows Server 2008 R2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:02:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</guid><description>OTRS is an exceptionally flexible ITIL compliant ticketing/helpdesk solution, which runs beautifully on almost any LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl (yes, I know it’s PHP really;-)) server, but what happens when you work in a Windows-only environment? OTRS does have a Windows installer, but it is somewhat clunky and requires almost as much work to configure as manually installing. Installing as components allows you to upgrade portions of the system and have more granular control over the setup.</description></item></channel></rss>
