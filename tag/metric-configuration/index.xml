In the past you would either use the sample/examples to get them started and then go and find the specific metric names while, this was usually quite time consuming.
In recent versions of vROps however, VMware have introduced a &amp;ldquo;builder&amp;rdquo; to help you properly format and slect the corect adapters/adapterkinds and metrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
