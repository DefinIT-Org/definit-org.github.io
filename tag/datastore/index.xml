&lt;p&gt;The LUNs had been unpresented at the hardware level by the storage team, but had not been unmounted or removed from vCenter. This is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the way to remove storage - let me re-iterate: &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2011/11/best-practice-how-to-correctly-remove-a-lun-from-an-esx-host.html" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; remove storage properly
&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately in this case the storage was removed badly - doing this can lead to a condition called &amp;ldquo;All Paths Down&amp;rdquo; or APD which is best explained by Cormac Hogan (@vmwarestorage) in the article &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2011/08/all-path-down-apd-handling-in-50.html" target="_blank"&gt;
