Aside from the obvious addition of cloud costings and comparisons and a reworked capacity planning (from the ground up) and new hook in to Wavefront (which I really like) there has been some real effort to improve how you can further automate things from vROps.</description></item><item><title>Missing actions in vRealize Automation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/missing-actions-in-vrealize-automation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 11:36:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/missing-actions-in-vrealize-automation/</guid><description>Recently the team I am working with came across an interesting bug/issue with actions missing from deployed VMs. We had checked and double checked the entitlements yet the actions that should be available to the end-user/customer were not listed.
Everything appeared to point to a permissions issue until one of the team members noticed something with regards to blueprints in the catalog.
Before I continue with what we observed and how we &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; it please bear in mind the blueprints were created programmatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
