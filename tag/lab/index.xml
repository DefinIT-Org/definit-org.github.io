I hope that it was helpful and maybe a few of you will be building some awesome labs in the cloud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravello very kindly sponsored a free home lab, equivalent to the vExpert 1000 hours account as a prize for my session at the UKVMUG yesterday. Using a high tech random number generator and an Excel spread sheet the winner was picked, so without further ado, congratulations go to…&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building a vRealize Automation NSX Lab on Ravello</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/building-a-vrealize-automation-nsx-lab-on-ravello/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 17:06:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/building-a-vrealize-automation-nsx-lab-on-ravello/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/09/image_thumb22.png" alt=""&gt;As a vExpert, I am blessed to get 1000 CPU hours access to Ravello&amp;rsquo;s awesome platform and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the AutoLab deployments tailored for Ravello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar with &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Ravello&amp;rsquo;s offering&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (where have you been?!) then it&amp;rsquo;s basically a custom hypervisor (HVX) running on either AWS or Google Cloud that allows you to run nested environments on those platforms. I did say it&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Book review: Networking for VMware Administrators</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2014 09:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I recently got my hands on a copy* of Chris Wahl and Steve Pantol’s Networking for VMware Administrators and was very keen to read it – especially given the reputation of the authors. I came to the book as someone who is at CCNA level (although now expired) and someone who regularly designs complex VMware networks using standard and distributed switches. I would class myself as having a fairly decent understanding of networking, though not a networking specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing vCOps 5.8 in the DefinIT Lab &amp;ndash; 4GB RAM and 2 vCPU</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/installing-vcops-5-8-in-the-definit-lab-4gb-ram-and-2-vcpu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 11:38:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/installing-vcops-5-8-in-the-definit-lab-4gb-ram-and-2-vcpu/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;There’s no doubt that vCOps is a great product for proactively monitoring your vSphere environment, but it’s a hefty package for the lab. The minimum recommended RAM is a whopping 16GB – in my lab that’s the whole of my management host! I recently needed to do some testing so I wanted to get it running in the lab with the barest minimum I could get working, and it turns out you can get working with just 4GB and 2 CPU…albeit you wouldn’t want to monitor much! I also want to use vFlash Read Cache to accelerate I/O in the lab – this requires upgrading VMtools and the VM hardware to version 10.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What sort of lab would you build for $2000?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/what-sort-of-lab-would-you-build-for-2000/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 10:39:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/what-sort-of-lab-would-you-build-for-2000/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;John Troyer (@jtroyer) asked a question on Twitter last night about a CloudCred prize of $1000-2000:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That got me thinking – was it possible to create an entire 2 host lab with storage on a $2000 budget? My first step was to convert it into a proper currency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured that I’d stick to the Intel NUC route that I’ve gone down for &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/lab/" title="Lab"&gt;my lab&lt;/a&gt; at home – I love the NUC for its tiny form factor, silent operation and really low power consumption. There are down sides – it can only take 16GB RAM, only one mSATA disk and only has one gigabit NIC. I don’t think any of those are too big a deal for a personal lab though – certainly I’ve not had any problems building and testing VMware products on my single NUC. I’d drop in an 8GB stick of RAM and an Intel 60GB mSATA SSD per NUC – you could always go 16GB later by adding another 8GB stick in the 2nd slot. I picked the Intel mSATA disk for it’s controller and throughput figures – there are larger and cheaper ones but not with the same write performance. Since the use of SSD is massively in focus with vFlash, PernixData FVP and several other technologies, you wouldn’t want to miss out. I’ve also added an 8GB USB3 flash drive per NUC to boot ESXi from.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
