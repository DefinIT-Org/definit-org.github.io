Would they need a management pack or is this something vROps can do out of the box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer to this is yes, but it is not immediately obvious how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great many metrics that come with a vanilla build of vROps but not all of them are enabled a good example of these are the sensor metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if I want full metrics? in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;If you have used vCOps (previous version of vROPs) you will likely remember the option in the admin panel where you could change the number of metrics being collected from &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many found, this option drop down was not present in vROps and there appeared to be no replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the good news, the ability to collect those metrics has not been removed rather it&amp;rsquo;s just a little more hidden (by design)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
