&lt;h2 id="so-why-do-i-think-you-should-you-go"&gt;So why do I think you should you go? &lt;a class="anchor" href="#so-why-do-i-think-you-should-you-go"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are using VMware technologies/products in your workplace or you are regularly consulting on said VMware products, the VMUG events are in my opinion invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what experience/knowledge you have of the products, whether you are very new to virtualization or an old hand I  guarantee you will come away from any VMUG meeting having learned something useful or dare I say been a great source/help to others whom you have met and networked with.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
