Sure its quite self indulgent but seeing other people&amp;rsquo;s lists gives you a small glimpse into their life. After all musical taste is a hugely personal thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached my top 10 by considering which bands and albums had the biggest impact on me at a given time in my life and that I still enjoy today. It was kinda cool to go through my own play lists and see what &amp;ldquo;oldies&amp;rdquo; cropped up still in my current playlists of which I listen to on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
