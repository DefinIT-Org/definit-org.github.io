Sure its quite self indulgent but seeing other people&amp;rsquo;s lists gives you a small glimpse into their life. After all musical taste is a hugely personal thing.
I approached my top 10 by considering which bands and albums had the biggest impact on me at a given time in my life and that I still enjoy today.</description></item></channel></rss>
