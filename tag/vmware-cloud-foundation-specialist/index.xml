&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Master Services Competencies (MSCs) are VMware partner designations designed to recognize services-capable partners with delivery expertise and experience within a VMware solution area.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind I sat the VCF Specialist exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-exam"&gt;The Exam &lt;a class="anchor" href="#the-exam"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exam covers a broad spectrum of VMware technologies (vSphere, NSX-T, vSAN, Tanzu) I was apprehensive about it as there is an awful lot of material to cover that the exam expects you to have good knowledge of. You have 130 minutes to work through 72 question It is available as a remote-proctored exam, and requires a score of 300 or more to pass.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
