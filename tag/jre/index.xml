I&amp;rsquo;m developing some very large, very complicated workflows for vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO), and as it&amp;rsquo;s a Java based application it will probably come as no surprise to many that the performance of the client drops off sharply as the client&amp;rsquo;s RAM usage creeps up.
When working on some of the larger workflows, or after long sessions and heavy clipboard use, the client would become (even more) sluggish and in some cases would freeze entirely.</description></item><item><title>Unable to start PernixData FVP Management Server – service-specific error code 0</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/unable-to-start-pernixdata-fvp-management-server-service-specific-error-code-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 10:14:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/unable-to-start-pernixdata-fvp-management-server-service-specific-error-code-0/</guid><description>Having finally got some SSDs to be able to use my PernixPro/PernixPrime NFR license, I thought it was about time to get PernixData&amp;rsquo;s FVP 2.0 running in my lab again. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used FVP in my lab since it was running in beta, so I was keen to see the awesome new features in action. It really is an easy install process and took me less than an hour to get my cluster up and running with VMs I/O being accelerated.</description></item></channel></rss>
