I came to the book as someone who is at CCNA level (although now expired) and someone who regularly designs complex VMware networks using standard and distributed switches. I would class myself as having a fairly decent understanding of networking, though not a networking specialist.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Software iSCSI multipathing on ESXi 4.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/configuring-software-iscsi-multipathing-on-esxi-4-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2010 16:40:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/configuring-software-iscsi-multipathing-on-esxi-4-1/</guid><description>Recently I had cause to configure iSCSI multipathing on a test ESXi server. The production environment servers use iSCSI HBAs to connect to the back end storage, so multipathing them is a straight-forward setup.
It’s good practice to separate VMotion, virtual machine and iSCSI traffic, it also helps you manage those logical and physical connections.
Connect to your ESXi server using the vSphere Client and select the host. Go to the configuration tab and click “Add Networking…”.</description></item></channel></rss>
