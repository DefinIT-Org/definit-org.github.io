While we all know that, automating day to day operations tasks is becoming the choice of an IT organization, it is hard for them to find a solution which can completely understand their business policies and provide them the efficiency they need from automating simple operational tasks.
Based on our research, we found that, one of the most time consuming activity done by an Virtual Infrastructure Administrator is to juggle resources between the changing business requirements and ensure that every VM which is being hosted in their environment is BEING SERVED WELL.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 1 – What’s New with vROps 6.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:02:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</guid><description>Time to share the recording of the first episode of the vROps Webinar Series 2017.

This time around, Sunny and I thought about discussing Architecture of vROps. To some, it might sound strange as for smaller deployments you might not have to worry about Sizing and Architecture much since it is pretty simple to install and configure a small or a medium node for a small shop. However as your monitoring needs grow and you start adding solutions for monitoring data sources beyond vSphere, you would need to think about scaling up or scaling out.</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 : Part 4 – Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 08:17:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>As promised, I am posting the recording for the 4th Session of vROps Webinar Series 2016.
