We discussed the following use cases and demonstrated them in live environments:
Use Case 1 - Full-Stack vSphere Monitoring. From application to Infrastructure.
Use Case 2 - Amazon RDS Workloads. Monitoring public cloud workloads with vROps.
Use Case 3 - vROps Extensibility. Metrics, Logs and Costing come together along with other 3rd party extensibility options.</description></item><item><title>Announcing Part 2 – #vROps Webinar series 2017 – “Full Stack” monitoring with vRealize Operations Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/announcing-part-2-vrops-webinar-series-2017-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:50:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/announcing-part-2-vrops-webinar-series-2017-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</guid><description>As promised, vROps Webinar Series 2017 is back with the second episode of the year.
