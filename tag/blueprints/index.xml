Everything appeared to point to a permissions issue until one of the team members noticed something with regards to blueprints in the catalog.
Before I continue with what we observed and how we &amp;ldquo;fixed&amp;rdquo; it please bear in mind the blueprints were created programmatically.</description></item></channel></rss>
