It&amp;rsquo;s still teething, so report any bugs you see! I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a cleanup of the categories to remove some of the less &amp;ldquo;category&amp;rdquo; like ones - they were being a bit blurred with the tags.
Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m really quite amazed to say that my blog is now well over 100 visitors a day on a weekday, so thank you for visiting!</description></item><item><title>Major office move completed!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/12/major-office-move-completed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2008 10:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/12/major-office-move-completed/</guid><description>If anyone visits here regularly, rather than by google search, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed that I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted much lately. This is because of a major office move at work which I have been managing from the technical side of things, and moving a 25 server operation isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy job. I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded the entire network infrastructure throughout from SOHO to enterprise products.
Normal service will resume shortly!</description></item><item><title>Free vector graphics</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/free-vector-graphics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 08:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/free-vector-graphics/</guid><description>If, like me, you enjoy a bit of design in your free time then I have a great site for you…
Blog Spoon Graphics is a fantastic site, with loads of free vector graphics downloads that you can use in your designs. It&amp;rsquo;s also got some great tips and stuff on vector art - take a look!
This is probably a little off-topic, but hey - I like this site! And no, I haven&amp;rsquo;t sold out, it&amp;rsquo;s not a sponsored link…I just like it!</description></item><item><title>Something for nothing!?!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/something-for-nothing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2008 10:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/something-for-nothing/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Nothing can come of nothing&amp;rdquo; - to quote King Lear, but it seems this is not always true. Marc Andre is giving away an album, and all he asks in return is that you mention it to your friends. I&amp;rsquo;ve not listened to it yet, but even if I hate it…it was free!
Thanks to Matt Hellyer for the tip off.</description></item></channel></rss>
