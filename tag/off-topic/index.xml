It&amp;rsquo;s still teething, so report any bugs you see! I&amp;rsquo;ve had a bit of a cleanup of the categories to remove some of the less &amp;ldquo;category&amp;rdquo; like ones - they were being a bit blurred with the tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m really quite amazed to say that my blog is now well over 100 visitors a day on a weekday, so thank you for visiting! (Now if only a few more clicked on the adverts, It would start to recover some of the cost of hosting!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Major office move completed!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/12/major-office-move-completed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Dec 2008 10:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/12/major-office-move-completed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If anyone visits here regularly, rather than by google search, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed that I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted much lately. This is because of a major office move at work which I have been managing from the technical side of things, and moving a 25 server operation isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy job. I&amp;rsquo;ve upgraded the entire network infrastructure throughout from SOHO to enterprise products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal service will resume shortly!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Free vector graphics</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/free-vector-graphics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 08:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/free-vector-graphics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you enjoy a bit of design in your free time then I have a great site for you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Blog Spoon Graphics &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;is a fantastic site, with loads of free vector graphics downloads that you can use in your designs. It&amp;rsquo;s also got some great tips and stuff on vector art - take a look!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a little off-topic, but hey - I like this site! And no, I haven&amp;rsquo;t sold out, it&amp;rsquo;s not a sponsored link…I just like it!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Something for nothing!?!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/something-for-nothing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2008 10:31:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/something-for-nothing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nothing can come of nothing&amp;rdquo; - to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;quote King Lear&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, but it seems this is not always true. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Marc Andre&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; is giving away an album, and all he asks in return is that you mention it to your friends. I&amp;rsquo;ve not listened to it yet, but even if I hate it…it was free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Matt Hellyer&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; for the tip off.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
