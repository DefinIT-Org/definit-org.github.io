That article helped me relax into who I am from a professional point of view, but it also challenged me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career. Talking to and observing peers whom I respected gave me a lot of inspiration to re-evaluate what I was doing in my career, why I did what I was doing and perhaps most importantly of all was I really being the best I can be?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simon’s #VMworld 2017: Tuesday</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/simons-vmworld-day-3-tuesday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Sep 2017 09:20:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/simons-vmworld-day-3-tuesday/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/09/VMworld-2017.jpg" alt=""&gt;I managed to dodge the rainstorms in the morning before arriving, the hotel being just across the road from the Venue was a huge help (Thank you &lt;a href="https://xtravirt.com/" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main session was great particularly HCX announcement and the VR admin demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then hit the solutions exchange as soon as it opened. There are all the usual suspects there -except- Cisco (anyone know why?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also great to see the guys from &lt;a href="https://bluemedora.com/" target="_blank"&gt;

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving in early on Sunday as the local flight choices are more limited from Bristol than perhaps a larger Airport, very fortunate to have a hotel so close to the VMworld venue, perhaps not so great for the evening activities but I am happy with it this way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than registration (4pm-8pm) and hopefully catching up with a few folk who have also arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I had the pleasure to meet many awesome people from the vCommunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
