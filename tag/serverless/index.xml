What do I mean? Well each year there is the new hotness, the next thing/innovation you are told you need or should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the innovations and new tech are ground breaking awesomeness and most certainly offer new opportunities for the infrastructure masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for progress, if you are not moving forward and regularly looking for sensible ways to improve what you do and the infrastructure you use then I really do think you are in the wrong industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
