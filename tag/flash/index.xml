It makes you truly appreciate the awesome power of FVP, even on my less than spectacular hardware in my lab, when it&amp;rsquo;s taken away for a while.
Now that FVP 3.0 has GA&amp;rsquo;d, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to getting my lab storage accelerated - it makes a huge difference.</description></item><item><title>Blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani – PernixData</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 15:31:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</guid><description>Recently I had the good fortune to be invited along to a blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani CTO and Co-founder of PernixData.Those of you not in the know Satyam already has quite the track record, more notably for authoring 50+ patents, Principle engineer and Storage CTO for VMware (10 years). So it is safe to say he knows a thing or two about storage and related technology!
Nine of us (bloggers) were in attendance.</description></item><item><title>Pernixdata – ICM and initial impressions – part 1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/pernixdata-icm-and-initial-impressions-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 17:37:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/pernixdata-icm-and-initial-impressions-part-1/</guid><description>Since the keynote by Frank Denneman at the LonVMUG many months ago the PernixData product has been something I wanted to test to see what benefits it may or may not bring to our SQL environment, I did have the good fortune to briefly beta test it last year but this blog post will cover the current full version (FVP 1.0.2.0). I am aware that 1.5 is just around the corner and with it comes full support for vSphere 5.</description></item><item><title>Reclaiming an SSD device from ESXi 5.5 Virtual Flash</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/reclaiming-an-ssd-device-from-esxi-5-5-virtual-flash/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2014 14:02:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/reclaiming-an-ssd-device-from-esxi-5-5-virtual-flash/</guid><description>After having a play with Virtual Flash and Host Caching on one of my lab hosts I wanted to re-use the SSD drive, but couldn’t seem to get vFlash to release the drive. I disabled flash usage on all VMs and disabled the Host Cache, then went to the Virtual Flash Resource Management page to click the “Remove All” button. That failed with errors:
“Host’s virtual flash resource is inaccessible.</description></item></channel></rss>
