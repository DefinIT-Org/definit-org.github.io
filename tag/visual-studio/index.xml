My current set up at work means that I am maintaining one version of our web site while working on developing a new one - not uncommon.

The basic installation of Vista from the control panel will not be sufficient for a VS install, you must add&amp;nbsp;IIS Metabase Compatibility (you&amp;rsquo;ll see why later),&amp;nbsp;.</description></item></channel></rss>
