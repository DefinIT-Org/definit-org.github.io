They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.
One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card.</description></item><item><title>Updating Cisco SG300 firmware the command line way</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/02/updating-cisco-sg300-firmware-the-command-line-way/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2015 15:14:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/02/updating-cisco-sg300-firmware-the-command-line-way/</guid><description>&amp;lt;img class=&amp;ldquo;alignright wp-image-5603 size-medium&amp;rdquo; src=&amp;quot;/images/2015/02/cisco_SG300-20_1.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;Cisco SG300-20&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;300&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;180&amp;rdquo; of upgrading my lab switch, which is the excellent Cisco SG300-20, I&amp;rsquo;ve not had a chance to update the firmware since it was released 6 months ago because of the downtime. For some reason I prefer configuring the SG300 from the command line - a hangover from my old networking days I suppose, but somehow it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel right to me to use the GUI!</description></item></channel></rss>
