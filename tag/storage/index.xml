Last time around we looked closely into the features of vROps 6.5 and as stated during that webinar, we will now show you how you can unlock the full capabilities of vROps using the extensibility of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been following the Webinar Series, by now you have a complete visibility into the capabilities of vROps, when it comes to monitoring the vSphere infrastructure. While this infrastructure is important for the IaaS provider, what business cares about is Applications. The good news is that vROps provides you an extensible platform which can be leveraged to extend the product capability into any area where metrics exist. This could be at the layers of your Software Defined Datacenter such as Compute, Network &amp;amp; Storage, or in the Application Stack and it&amp;rsquo;s tiers such as App, Web and DB.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Web Client – VSAN is Turned Off – Edit button disappears</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/09/vsphere-web-client-vsan-is-turned-off-edit-button-disappears/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Sep 2016 16:10:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/09/vsphere-web-client-vsan-is-turned-off-edit-button-disappears/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into a strange one with my lab today where the previously working VSAN cluster couldn&amp;rsquo;t be enabled.

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this time around we will move our focus from vROps as a Product and related features to the concept of running your SDDC operations with vRealize Operations Dashboards. Just to clarify, this is not a session where we will teach you to create dashboards, but this is a session where we would share how a set of Customised Dashboards can help any organisation&amp;rsquo;s IT to get an insight into Storage, Network &amp;amp; Compute within your SDDC. While vROps is primarily a Performance Management and Capacity Planning tool, we will take you to the other important aspects as well such as Availability and Configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>PernixData FVP 3.0 GA and Lab Install</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/pernixdata-fvp-3-0-ga-and-lab-install/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2015 12:56:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/pernixdata-fvp-3-0-ga-and-lab-install/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;lt;img class=&amp;ldquo;alignright size-medium wp-image-3968&amp;rdquo; src=&amp;quot;/images/2014/02/pernixdata1.png&amp;quot; alt=&amp;ldquo;pernixdata&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;300&amp;rdquo; height=&amp;ldquo;80&amp;rdquo; since vSphere 6 was released, simply because I can&amp;rsquo;t afford to wait on learning new versions until 3rd party software catches up. It makes you truly appreciate the awesome power of FVP, even on my less than spectacular hardware in my lab, when it&amp;rsquo;s taken away for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that FVP 3.0 has GA&amp;rsquo;d, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to getting my lab storage accelerated - it makes a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani – PernixData</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 15:31:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the good fortune to be invited along to a blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani CTO and Co-founder of &lt;a href="http://www.pernixdata.com/" title="PernixData website"&gt;PernixData&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/05/satyamvaghani-304.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of you not in the know Satyam already has quite the track record, more notably for authoring 50+ patents, Principle engineer and Storage CTO for VMware (10 years). So it is safe to say he knows a thing or two about storage and related technology!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things I would like to point out. First of all Infinio works &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;only with NFS storage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, secondly it &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;does not require flash storage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; as it utilizes the host RAM instead however it provides &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;only&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;read acceleration&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Book review: Networking for VMware Administrators</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2014 09:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I recently got my hands on a copy* of Chris Wahl and Steve Pantol’s Networking for VMware Administrators and was very keen to read it – especially given the reputation of the authors. I came to the book as someone who is at CCNA level (although now expired) and someone who regularly designs complex VMware networks using standard and distributed switches. I would class myself as having a fairly decent understanding of networking, though not a networking specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Pernixdata – ICM and initial impressions – part 1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/pernixdata-icm-and-initial-impressions-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 17:37:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/pernixdata-icm-and-initial-impressions-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/02/pernixdata1.png" alt=""&gt;Since the keynote by Frank Denneman at the LonVMUG many months ago the PernixData product has been something I wanted to test to see what benefits it may or may not bring to our SQL environment, I did have the good fortune to briefly beta test it last year but this blog post will cover the current full version (FVP 1.0.2.0). I am aware that 1.5 is just around the corner and with it comes full support for vSphere 5.5 whereas the current version that I will be installing supports ESXi hosts on 5.0 or 5.1 and vCenter 5.5 (not mentioned in the minimum requirements)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Basics: Correctly decommissioning a vSphere Datastore</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-basics-correctly-decommissioning-a-vsphere-datastore/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2013 12:04:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-basics-correctly-decommissioning-a-vsphere-datastore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;You’d be surprised how many times I see datastore that’s just been un-presented from hosts rather than decommissioned correctly – in one notable case I saw a distributed switch crippled for a whole cluster because the datastore in question was being used to store the VDS configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the process that I follow to ensure datastores are decommissioned without any issues – they need to comply with these requirements&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Host disk write latency errors – troubleshooting – part 2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/03/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting-part-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2013 13:23:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/03/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As some of you read previously, I had been experiencing disk latency issues on our SAN and tried many initial methods to troubleshoot and understand the root cause. Due to other more pressing issues this was placed aside until we started to experience VMs being occasionaly restarted by vSphere HA as the lock had been lost on a given VMDK file. (NOT GOOD!!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply because of the size and age of the environment, some of our production clusters have now reached the limit (including local paths) - you see this message in the logs&lt;/p&gt;
