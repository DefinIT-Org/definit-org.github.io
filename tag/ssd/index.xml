I haven&amp;rsquo;t used FVP in my lab since it was running in beta, so I was keen to see the awesome new features in action. It really is an easy install process and took me less than an hour to get my cluster up and running with VMs I/O being accelerated.</description></item><item><title>Blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani – PernixData</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 15:31:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</guid><description>Recently I had the good fortune to be invited along to a blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani CTO and Co-founder of PernixData.
Those of you not in the know Satyam already has quite the track record, more notably for authoring 50+ patents, Principle engineer and Storage CTO for VMware (10 years). So it is safe to say he knows a thing or two about storage and related technology!
Nine of us (bloggers) were in attendance.</description></item><item><title>Reclaiming an SSD device from ESXi 5.5 Virtual Flash</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/reclaiming-an-ssd-device-from-esxi-5-5-virtual-flash/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2014 14:02:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/reclaiming-an-ssd-device-from-esxi-5-5-virtual-flash/</guid><description>After having a play with Virtual Flash and Host Caching on one of my lab hosts I wanted to re-use the SSD drive, but couldn’t seem to get vFlash to release the drive. I disabled flash usage on all VMs and disabled the Host Cache, then went to the Virtual Flash Resource Management page to click the “Remove All” button. That failed with errors:
“Host’s virtual flash resource is inaccessible.”</description></item></channel></rss>
