Lab Environment This NSX-T lab environment is built as a nested lab on my physical hosts. There are four physical ESXi hosts, onto which I will deploy three ESXi VMs, a vCenter Server Appliance, NSX Manager, an NSX Controller cluster, and two NSX Edge Nodes.</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Adding a vCenter Compute Manager and Preparing Hosts</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/10/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-adding-a-vcenter-compute-manager-and-preparing-hosts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 14:08:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/10/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-adding-a-vcenter-compute-manager-and-preparing-hosts/</guid><description>Disclaimer!

The solution is to use UMDS to download the updates to a 2nd server that was hosted in the DMZ and then update the vCenter Server from there.</description></item><item><title>The case of the missing network adaptor: a.k.a Installing additional drivers on ESXi 4.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/the-case-of-the-missing-network-adaptor-a-k-a-installing-additional-drivers-on-esxi-4-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 14:15:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/the-case-of-the-missing-network-adaptor-a-k-a-installing-additional-drivers-on-esxi-4-1/</guid><description>Recently I installed and configured a client’s new ESXi host, they’re a small company and only require a single host. The host in question was an IBM x3650 M3, an excellent workhorse for virtualisation and one of 5 or 6 of the same model that I’ve installed in the last year. In addition to the onboard Broadcom Dual Gigabit NIC, we always install at least a second Intel PCIx Dual Gigabit card for resilience/redundancy/performance.</description></item><item><title>Remote Installation of SCOM 2007 R2 Agent on Threat Management Gateway Servers</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/01/remote-installation-of-scom-2007-r2-agent-on-threat-management-gateway-servers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2011 16:23:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/01/remote-installation-of-scom-2007-r2-agent-on-threat-management-gateway-servers/</guid><description>Getting a SCOM 2007 R2 SCOM agent on TMG is a useful way of monitoring TMG, especially with the SCOM TMG Management Pack – it’s not exactly “out-of-the-box” functionality though, with many sources I’ve read simply stating that it can’t be done. There are some half-working solutions I’ve seen, but nothing that worked for me.
The process involves simply opening the correct ports and protocols between the TMG servers and the SCOM management servers, which after a few attempts watching the live logs, I found.</description></item></channel></rss>
