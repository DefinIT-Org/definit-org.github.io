Because we are growing as an organisation, opportunities are surfacing on a regular basis.
My focus in the last 24 months has shifted from a more project to project focus to now being involved in several projects at once providing project and architectural governance as well as normal consultant duties.</description></item><item><title>VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization 2021 Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/11/vmware-certified-professional-data-center-virtualization-2021-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/11/vmware-certified-professional-data-center-virtualization-2021-exam-experience/</guid><description>Having not sat any VMware exams recently (MSC exam not including) I had to update my VMware certification status and therefore sit the VCP exam.
The VCP-DCV 2021 certification validates candidate skills to implement, manage, and troubleshoot a vSphere infrastructure, using best practices to provide a powerful, flexible, and secure foundation for business agility that can accelerate the transformation to cloud computing.
The Exam The exam covers a broad spectrum of vSphere components as you would expect.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Specialist Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/vmware-cloud-foundation-specialist-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/vmware-cloud-foundation-specialist-exam-experience/</guid><description>Being a Consultant within a VMware Principal Partner there are standards we need to meet and preferably exceed.
Master Services Competencies (MSCs) are VMware partner designations designed to recognize services-capable partners with delivery expertise and experience within a VMware solution area.
With that in mind I sat the VCF Specialist exam.
The Exam The exam covers a broad spectrum of VMware technologies (vSphere, NSX-T, vSAN, Tanzu) I was apprehensive about it as there is an awful lot of material to cover that the exam expects you to have good knowledge of.</description></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</guid><description>Since I started learning Kubernetes the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam has been a target for me, but it&amp;rsquo;s always seemed to be out of reach. The whole Kubernetes ecosystem is a vast and nebulous beast, with new projects rising to the fore all the time, and old projects fading from favour. The size and rapid development that make the field so interesting and powerful, are the same properties that make the learning curve so steep, and the entry bar so high.</description></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</guid><description>Since I started learning Kubernetes the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam has been a target for me, but it&amp;rsquo;s always seemed to be out of reach.

I am going to break it down in a yearly format and then summarize at the end.</description></item><item><title>2020 - Simon's decade in review</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/2020-simons-decade-in-review/</guid><description>So it being 2020 now I thought it would be a pleasant exercise to quickly glance over the previous ten years and reflect a little.

That article helped me relax into who I am from a professional point of view, but it also challenged me.
I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career.</description></item><item><title>Looking back on 2017 and looking forward into 2018</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/looking-back-on-2017-and-looking-forward-into-2018/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2018 09:59:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/01/looking-back-on-2017-and-looking-forward-into-2018/</guid><description>Upon seeing others in the wider community making a blog post like this as a marker in the sand I thought I would follow suit as a way to see what I have learned and goals I would like to achieve in the coming year. 2017 was a good year and a very busy one at that, I got to see a lot of new places on my work travels and met some really amazing, clever and talented people.</description></item><item><title>Why do IT projects struggle or fail?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/why-do-it-projects-struggle-or-fail/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2017 22:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/why-do-it-projects-struggle-or-fail/</guid><description>Why do IT projects fail?
I am sure if you ask that question to ten people you will get 10 different answers, or at the very least a wide variety of reasons. The product chosen to deliver the solution was a poor match, the product was implemented incorrectly, the PM sucked, the Vendor gave no support, insufficient training material/resources, poor interoperability, the list goes on and on.
One issue I have observed from time to time on my travels is quite different from the above listed examples.</description></item><item><title>The next big thing…</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/the-next-big-thing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 10:01:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/the-next-big-thing/</guid><description>Just under two months ago I left my role at Xtravirt and started life as a contractor. At that point I was content to live the contractor life for a year or so and see what opportunities came along. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect opportunity to come along so quickly!
TLDR; I&amp;rsquo;m joining VMware as part of the PSO NSX practice!
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression.</description></item></channel></rss>
