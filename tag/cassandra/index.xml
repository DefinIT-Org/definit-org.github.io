I think the problem occurred because the IP addresses were all changed and the VMs shut down, without time for the application to update the node IPs.
The symptoms:
The web interface was down, a netstat -ano | grep -i “443” showed the service was listening _service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes /var/log/loginsight/runtime.</description></item></channel></rss>
