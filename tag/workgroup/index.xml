It’s pretty simple to install in a domain environment – you run the installer to create a collection server, then activate the forwarder on the client servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to servers you really want to audit, those that are by definition more at risk from security breach because they are publicly accessible, it’s not so straightforward. Take for example that web server, or FTP host in your DMZ, certainly not domain joined and probably bombarded by daily brute force password attacks. Select the SCOM agent in the console and enable Audit Collection Services?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
