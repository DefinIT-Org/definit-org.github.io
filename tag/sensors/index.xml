Would they need a management pack or is this something vROps can do out of the box?
The short answer to this is yes, but it is not immediately obvious how.
There are a great many metrics that come with a vanilla build of vROps but not all of them are enabled aÂ good example of these are the sensor metrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
