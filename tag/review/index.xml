over the previous ten years and reflect a little. Before I even begin I will say
I have never been happier in my career and work/life balance (which is always an
on going effort to keep appropriate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to break it down in a yearly format and then summarize at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Learning Veeam Backup and Replication for VMware vSphere</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/book-review-learning-veeam-backup-and-replication-for-vmware-vsphere/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2014 11:23:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/book-review-learning-veeam-backup-and-replication-for-vmware-vsphere/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I was recently sent a copy of Christian Mohn&amp;rsquo;s new book &amp;ldquo;Learning Veeam Backup and Replication for VMware vSphere&amp;rdquo; to review, and as ever this is my honest opinion of this book. I am not receiving anything other than the copy of the book for this review. I don&amp;rsquo;t work for a vendor, so I have no axe to grind!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book starts of with explanations of basic backup strategies and explains principals like Grandfather-Father-Son media rotation and RPO/RTOs. From there it dives into the architecture of Veeam BR and its components. The remainder of chapter 1 covers a walk through of the installation of the product.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
