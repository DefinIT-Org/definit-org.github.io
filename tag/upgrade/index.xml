&lt;p&gt;Firstly and arguably the big change.&lt;/p&gt;

You can upgrade vRealize Suite products as new versions become available in your vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager will only allow upgrades to compatible and supported versions of vRealize Suite products. Specific vRealize Automation, vRealize Operations, vRealize Log Insight, and Workspace ONE Access versions will no longer be listed in the VMware Cloud Foundation BOM.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Upgrading vRA withvRLCM and JAVA versions</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/04/upgrading-vra-withvrlcm-and-java-versions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/04/upgrading-vra-withvrlcm-and-java-versions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently upgraded an instance of vRA from 7.2 to 7.5 and rather than do it the manual way I used VMware’s vRealize LifeCycle Manager (version 2.0 update 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything was going great and according to plan, the vRLCM pre-requisites checker made short work of all of the checks you need to do before you start an upgrade of vRA. You can see below vRLCM does a great job of keeping you informed of the current progress and in a really elegant way.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Upgrading PKS with NSX-T from 1.0.x to 1.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/06/upgrading-pks-with-nsx-t-from-1-0-x-to-1-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 19:31:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/06/upgrading-pks-with-nsx-t-from-1-0-x-to-1-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Yesterday, Pivotal Container Service 1.1 dropped and, as it’s something I’ve been actively learning in my lab, I wanted to jump on the upgrade straight away. PKS with NSX-T is a really hot topic right now and I think it’s going to be a big part of the future CNA landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Lab PKS 1.0.4 deployment is configured as a &amp;ldquo;NO-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) Topology” as depicted in the diagram below (from the PKS documentation). My setup has these network characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Upgrading to NSX-T 2.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday saw the release of NSX-T 2.1, with some new features and also some usability enhancements.

&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;m mid-way through this blog series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d stick in the upgrade as a little bonus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be upgrading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vCenter Server Appliance - currently 5.5 update 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vSphere Update Manager - currently 5.5 update 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 HP N54L resource hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Intel NUC management host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my lab I run various VMware software suites listed below, although I typically run them in nested environments to keep my lab install relatively clean.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere 6 Lab Upgrade – Upgrading ESXi 5.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/vsphere-6-lab-upgrade-upgrading-esxi-5-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 19:11:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/vsphere-6-lab-upgrade-upgrading-esxi-5-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/07/vSphereLogo.png" alt=""&gt;I tested vSphere 6 quite intensively when it was in beta, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t ever upgrade my lab - basically because I need a stable environment to work on and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure that I could maintain that with the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vSphere 5.5, VMware dropped the drivers for quite a few consumer grade NICs - in 6 they&amp;rsquo;ve gone a step further and actually blocked quite a few of these using a VIB package.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download and mount the VMware-VCSA-all-6.0.0-2562643 ISO image (mounted as G:\ on my workstation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browse the ISO and run the Client Integration Plugin &amp;ldquo;G:\vcsa\VMware-ClientIntegrationPlugin-6.0.0.exe&amp;rdquo; - it&amp;rsquo;s a simple next, next finish sort of install.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
