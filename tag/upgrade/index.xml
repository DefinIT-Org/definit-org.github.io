Firstly and arguably the big change.
vRealize Suite vRealize Lifecycle Manager 8.6.2, upgrade and deployment of the vRealize Suite products is managed by vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. You can upgrade vRealize Suite products as new versions become available in your vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading vRA with vRLCM and JAVA versions</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/04/upgrading-vra-with-vrlcm-and-java-versions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/04/upgrading-vra-with-vrlcm-and-java-versions/</guid><description>I recently upgraded an instance of vRA from 7.2 to 7.5 and rather than do it the manual way I used VMware’s vRealize LifeCycle Manager (version 2.0 update 3).
Everything was going great and according to plan, the vRLCM pre-requisites checker made short work of all of the checks you need to do before you start an upgrade of vRA. You can see below vRLCM does a great job of keeping you informed of the current progress and in a really elegant way.</description></item><item><title>Upgrading PKS with NSX-T from 1.0.x to 1.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/06/upgrading-pks-with-nsx-t-from-1-0-x-to-1-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 19:31:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/06/upgrading-pks-with-nsx-t-from-1-0-x-to-1-1/</guid><description>Yesterday, Pivotal Container Service 1.1 dropped and, as it’s something I’ve been actively learning in my lab, I wanted to jump on the upgrade straight away. PKS with NSX-T is a really hot topic right now and I think it’s going to be a big part of the future CNA landscape.
My Lab PKS 1.0.4 deployment is configured as a &amp;ldquo;NO-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) Topology” as depicted in the diagram below (from the PKS documentation).</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Upgrading to NSX-T 2.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</guid><description>Yesterday saw the release of NSX-T 2.1, with some new features and also some usability enhancements. You can check out the release notes here https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-21-Release-Notes.html
As I&amp;rsquo;m mid-way through this blog series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d stick in the upgrade as a little bonus!
Download the upgrade bundle Validate the version and status of NSX-T components Check the Controller cluster status and Manager connections are up.
Validate the hosts are installed, and have a connection to the controller and manager.</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.2 – upgrade and utilization dashboards</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:25:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</guid><description>As you will see the upgrade is simple and even though its early days I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything that has been broken!
