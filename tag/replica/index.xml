HA is a great feature and in my opinion should be considered seriously with any deployment (where possible).
Not only does HA protect your Master node (which essentially behaves as an index for your vROps cluster and if lost will render your cluster dead unless you have a working backup of your cluster) it will also allow your cluster to tolerate a data node failure.</description></item></channel></rss>
