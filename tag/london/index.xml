Generally it was a great day, with loads of really good sessions and some really cool community and vendor content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever it was great day for socialising and networking with people who you interact with on twitter. For me one of the major benefits of the VMUG is learning from other people’s experience. Twitter was alive with the hastag #LonVMUG and it definitely adds something to the day to be active&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
