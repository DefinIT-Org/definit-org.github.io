We completed the 7th session of the series where we spoke about vRealize Operations Manager Alerts and Symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alerts as we all know would always remain the heart and soul for the operations teams to run the data centers, whether old school or the modern software defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases you need alerts and more importantly you need meaningful and actionable alerts. In this part of the series, Simon and myself concentrated on making you aware of the alert constructs in vROps and as usual share experiences around how we help customers leverage the strong feature set of vROps to customize alerts and related symptoms, recommendations and actions to drastically reduce the Mean Time to Resolution of issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 7 : Working with Alerts &amp; Symptoms</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 17:54:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;Time to announce the next part of the year long webinar series on vRealize Operations Manager. With the last part of the series, we started focusing on content withing vROps.
