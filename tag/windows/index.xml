Terabytes of data that need auditing - e.g. to find customer data, or credit card information. How do you go about accessing all the data in all the trees? What about backups failing because someone removed the System account? Of course you can seize control of the folder by taking ownership and pushing down from a top level - but how do you preserve the existing Access Control Lists?</description></item><item><title>Installing and Configuring OTRS 3.0.9 on Windows Server 2008 R2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:02:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</guid><description>OTRS is an exceptionally flexible ITIL compliant ticketing/helpdesk solution, which runs beautifully on almost any LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl (yes, I know it’s PHP really;-)) server, but what happens when you work in a Windows-only environment? OTRS does have a Windows installer, but it is somewhat clunky and requires almost as much work to configure as manually installing. Installing as components allows you to upgrade portions of the system and have more granular control over the setup.</description></item><item><title>Testing throughput between two Windows Servers with NT Testing TCP Tool</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/testing-throughput-between-two-windows-servers-with-nt-testing-tcp-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2010 10:22:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/testing-throughput-between-two-windows-servers-with-nt-testing-tcp-tool/</guid><description>The NT Testing TCP Tool is a handy little tool for testing the throughput between two servers – and it’s free! It’s available to download here: http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx
First, you need to install the MSI on both ends – for the sake of this, say SERVER1 and SERVER2. Once you’ve installed it on the server, navigate to \Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\NT Testing TCP Tool, you should see a few copies of the tool for different architectures.</description></item><item><title>Unable to access admin shares (c$, d$, ADMIN$, IPC$) on Windows Server 2008 in a Workgroup</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/unable-to-access-admin-shares-c-d-admin-ipc-on-windows-server-2008-in-a-workgroup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2010 10:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/unable-to-access-admin-shares-c-d-admin-ipc-on-windows-server-2008-in-a-workgroup/</guid><description>If you have a Windows Server 2008 box in a workgroup that you require access to one of the admin shares, it can be a little more complicated than with Server 2003.

I’m going to be upgrading a Server 2008 R2 x64 SP2 Standard Edition virtual server to R2. To see what editions can and can’t be upgraded, check out this Technet Article, but it’s safe to say that you can’t upgrade across architectures (32-bit to 64-bit) and you can’t downgrade SKUs (Enterprise to Standard).</description></item><item><title>DCDIAG /TEST:DNS fails with errors regarding root hint servers</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/09/dcdiag-testdns-fails-with-errors-regarding-root-hint-servers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2009 16:19:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/09/dcdiag-testdns-fails-with-errors-regarding-root-hint-servers/</guid><description>I recently resolved an ongoing DNS issue where the Active Directory Integrated DNS was loaded in both the Domain and the DomainDNSZones partition of AD - this is a separate issue and should be resolved differently.

Fortunately, it’s pretty easy to fix! The authentication is handled by the Wired AutoConfig service, so it’s just a case of disabling it.</description></item><item><title>Dell Latitude E6500 blue screen of death on XP install/downgrade/reinstall</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/01/dell-latitude-e6500-blue-screen-of-death-on-xp-installdowngradereinstall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 12:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/01/dell-latitude-e6500-blue-screen-of-death-on-xp-installdowngradereinstall/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just had a frustrating few days trying to downgrade 4 Dell Latitude E6500 laptops to XP.

Not because I felt like he was weasling out of work - unusually they were very helpful. Not because installing XP is a hard task, I’ve done it over 100 times on all sorts of hardware.
No, the reason I let out a sigh was because this particular laptop, the Latitude X1, has no internal CD/DVD drive.</description></item><item><title>Using NTDSUtil to transfer FSMO Roles by command line</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/01/using-ntdsutil-to-transfer-fsmo-roles-by-command-line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2008 20:02:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/01/using-ntdsutil-to-transfer-fsmo-roles-by-command-line/</guid><description>I’ve just removed a domain controller (DC) from my root domain, the very first server not only in the domain, but the forest. The roles were migrating to a newer server, far more up to the job, but it isn’t a job to be taken lightly. If you mess up the root domain, you’ve potentially got problems all the way down your domain hierarchy.
&amp;nbsp; Let me explain; the primary domain controller in a domain (normally the first domain controller) hosts all the FSMO roles.</description></item><item><title>Installing on Vista: Error 1327 invalid drive when using mapped drives</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/11/installing-on-vista-error-1327-invalid-drive-when-using-mapped-drives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2007 19:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/11/installing-on-vista-error-1327-invalid-drive-when-using-mapped-drives/</guid><description>Incredibly irritating error when you go to install under your user account when you’re using mapped drives for your documents. All our domain users have a userfolder on the server, it’s mapped as z:\ and there is a folder redirection set up. It’s pretty standard in a corporate/domain environment, so why does it cause so many Vista installations to fail?

Vista tries to recover. As you can imagine that gets tiresome, so I tried repairing iTunes, reinstalling iTunes, installing older versions of iTunes, all to no avail. The solution in the end was to remove Quicktime and do a fresh install.</description></item><item><title>Installing Visual Studio 2003 SP1 on Vista</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-sp1-on-vista/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2007 19:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-sp1-on-vista/</guid><description>I’ve finally cracked the installation problems with VS 2003 SP1 on Vista. The problem seems to be that the SP must be installed under the same credentials that Visual Studio was installed. I.e. I installed Visual Studio under the domain administrator credentials, but I run my day-to-day under a standard user credential. When installing the SP1 I was elevating my standard user credential rather than running as the domain admin. I don’t know what difference that makes to anything, but it’s worked!</description></item><item><title>Moving and resizing a VMWare System Disk</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/moving-and-resizing-a-vmware-system-disk/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jun 2007 19:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/moving-and-resizing-a-vmware-system-disk/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently had to upgrade my VM Server due to an increase in load.

Whatever your opinion, I needed the HD space and was having no problems with Vista, so I bit the bullet.</description></item></channel></rss>
