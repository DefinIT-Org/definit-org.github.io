Terabytes of data that need auditing - e.g. to find customer data, or credit card information. How do you go about accessing all the data in all the trees? What about backups failing because someone removed the System account? Of course you can seize control of the folder by taking ownership and pushing down from a top level - but how do you preserve the existing Access Control Lists?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing and Configuring OTRS 3.0.9 on Windows Server 2008 R2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2011 15:02:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/07/installing-configuring-otrs-3-0-9-windows-server-2008/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/07/acquia_marina_logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;OTRS is an exceptionally flexible ITIL compliant ticketing/helpdesk solution, which runs beautifully on almost any LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl (yes, I know it’s PHP really;-)) server, but what happens when you work in a Windows-only environment? OTRS does have a Windows installer, but it is somewhat clunky and requires almost as much work to configure as manually installing. Installing as components allows you to upgrade portions of the system and have more granular control over the setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Testing throughput between two Windows Servers with NT Testing TCP Tool</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/testing-throughput-between-two-windows-servers-with-nt-testing-tcp-tool/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2010 10:22:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/testing-throughput-between-two-windows-servers-with-nt-testing-tcp-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The NT Testing TCP Tool is a handy little tool for testing the throughput between two servers – and it’s free! It’s available to download here: &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx" title="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx"&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/TCP_tool.mspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install the MSI on both ends – for the sake of this, say SERVER1 and SERVER2. Once you’ve installed it on the server, navigate to \Program Files\Microsoft Corporation\NT Testing TCP Tool, you should see a few copies of the tool for different architectures. Locate the correct .exe for you architecture and rename it to ntttcps.exe. Copy this and rename it to ntttcpr.exe – these form the sender and receiver parts of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unable to access admin shares (c$, d$, ADMIN$, IPC$) on Windows Server 2008 in a Workgroup</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/unable-to-access-admin-shares-c-d-admin-ipc-on-windows-server-2008-in-a-workgroup/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2010 10:07:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/unable-to-access-admin-shares-c-d-admin-ipc-on-windows-server-2008-in-a-workgroup/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;If you have a Windows Server 2008 box in a workgroup that you require access to one of the admin shares, it can be a little more complicated than with Server 2003.

We have bonded ADSL because our exchange still doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SDSL, and a leased line is overkill. Theoretically, we should have 28.1 Mbps download and 3.2Mbps upload - what I am actually seeing is about 1.7Mbps down and 1.9Mbps up. I have tested this on various servers, over various times and file sizes, there is no doubt that the performance is POOR.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Utilising more than 4GB of RAM with Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition – Enabling /PAE /3GB</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/utilising-more-than-4gb-of-ram-with-windows-server-2003-standard-edition-enabling-pae-3gb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2008 11:23:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/utilising-more-than-4gb-of-ram-with-windows-server-2003-standard-edition-enabling-pae-3gb/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We recently needed to upgrade one of our applications, and the new version requires an addition server instead of the application and SQL it requires a back end search, a front end web server and a SQL server.

The problem is that the actual processor usage is very light, and it is very hard to justify buying a whole new server that I know is going to be barely used.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Update your Windows Search or Windows Desktop Search</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/update-your-windows-search-or-windows-desktop-search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2008 14:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/update-your-windows-search-or-windows-desktop-search/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed a post over at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;David Overton&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; today that highlights a new release of Windows Search.

All our domain users have a userfolder on the server, it’s mapped as z:\ and there is a folder redirection set up.

 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;rsquo;re using UAC (User Account Control) you might need to map the network drive as the administrator. This is a pain in the @$$ because you have to disconnect the drive under your user account first. Of course, if you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve got ANY documents open, this will upset your profile. Anyway, steps for that: &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Disconnect the currently mapped drive. &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Open the command prompt as the administrator. Type &amp;quot;net use \\[server]\share and check that it&amp;amp;rsquo;s mapped by typing &amp;amp;ldquo;net use&amp;amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
 
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Open explorer and navigate to your shared folder and right click, use the &amp;amp;ldquo;Map Network Drive&amp;amp;rdquo; wizard to map the share under your user profile. &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;If all above fails (as in my case), your only option is to log in as a user that doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t map drives (machine local admin works for me, but then you have to enable that user as it&amp;amp;rsquo;s disabled by default. You also have to provide a password for it - don&amp;amp;rsquo;t forget to disable again after an install.)&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
