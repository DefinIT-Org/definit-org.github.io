As with a lot of Management Packs, to get the most out of it you need to have a dedicated RunAs account with local admin permissions on the servers you are monitoring (e.g. for the Backlogged Files reporting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy (and wrong) option here is to go with the less secure option and distribute a RunAs account to ALL servers. There are lots of reasons why you wouldn’t want to distribute the credentials to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; server in your SCOM installation – but just from a security standpoint, you shouldn’t do it! Selecting the “More Secure” option and distributing credentials only to servers which will require them is a much safer bet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
