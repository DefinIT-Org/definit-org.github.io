Event ID 1030 and 1058 every 5 minutes, looking into the detail for these events I can see its a replication issue for one of the GPOs.

The first step is to create a new vSwitch for the host-only cluster heartbeat network, don’t assign any network adaptors to the switch as it’s going to be local only.
Create a new virtual machine with a single hard disk. For the purposes of this test, I’ve assigned 2 vProcessors, 1GB RAM, 30GB drive for the OS, 1 vNIC in the default vSwitch0.</description></item><item><title>Fixing “Outlook(R) Mobile Access is supported only on Microsoft(R) Exchange Server 2003.

&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s odd&amp;rdquo;, I thought, &amp;ldquo;I only have Exchange Server 2003 in my organisation, how can I have an older version of Exchange?</description></item><item><title>I’ve achieved my MCSE</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/ive-achieved-my-mcse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Sep 2008 09:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/ive-achieved-my-mcse/</guid><description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been away with my friends at Firebrand again and guess what…MCSE Windows Server 2003!
