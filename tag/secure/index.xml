If the vROps appliance needs to be hardened there is already a VMware provided guide and tool to accommodate.

I wanted to be able to chose whether special characters were used, and the length of the password - typically if the password doesn&amp;rsquo;t used special characters I would increase the length significantly!
Characters should be randomly picked from:
a-z A-Z 0-9 (optional) ASCII special characters Inputs passwordLength - the length of the password to be generated (number) excludePunctuation - exclude the use of special characters if TRUE (boolean) Outputs generatedPassword - the generated password (SecureString) The SecureString type prevents the string from being displayed in the workflow attributes - it can be used as a normal string, but will be asterisk&amp;rsquo;d when displayed.</description></item><item><title>Configuring a Guest wireless network with restricted access to Production VLANs</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/configuring-guest-wireless-network-restricted-access-production-vlans/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2011 16:42:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/configuring-guest-wireless-network-restricted-access-production-vlans/</guid><description>It’s a fairly common requirement – setting up a guest WiFi network that is secure from the rest of your LAN. You need a secure WLAN access for the domain laptops which has full access to the Server and Client VLANs, but you also need a guest WLAN for visitors to the office which only allows internet access. Since the budget is limited, this must all be accomplished via a single Access Point – for this article, the access point is a Cisco WAP4410N.</description></item></channel></rss>
