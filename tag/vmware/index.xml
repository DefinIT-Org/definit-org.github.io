 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course took place over 4 days and was very well structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialy, we were given the VMware vision on Multi-Cloud and then we were straight into the &amp;ldquo;good stuff&amp;rdquo; hands-on-labs. This would be a consistent and well executed theme for the 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware now have an impressive global cloud presence utilising their partnerships with major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and several others.

Another of the packaged applications available is Fluent-bit, which enables log forwarding from your Kubernetes cluster and workloads to a range of supported logging endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of tweaks required in order to forward logs to vRealize Automation Log Insight Cloud. We need to use the HTTP output in the Fluent Bit configuration to forward the logs as a JSON payload to the Log Insight API. We also need to append an authentication header with an API key, and configure some tags so that the Tanzu Kubnernetes Grid Content Pack will pick up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ingress, SSL and DNS using TKG 1.4 Packages on TKGs Clusters</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve set up your shiny new Workload Management on vSphere, created a Namespace and deployed a cluster&amp;hellip;now what?!

For the most part, I try and keep my applications and configurations stateless - relying on &lt;code&gt;ConfigMaps&lt;/code&gt; for example to store application configuration. This means with a handful of YAML files in my Git repository I can restore everything to working order. Sometimes though, there&amp;rsquo;s no choice but to use a &lt;code&gt;PersistentVolume&lt;/code&gt; to provide some data persistance where you can&amp;rsquo;t capture it in a config file.

&lt;p&gt;Cody has gone down the route of using Hugo and AWS, which I respect, but just seems like too much work for me at the moment!

To be fair, it was probably aimed at business leaders and maybe not those that are technical. There were three customer stories, but I would have liked to have heard much more about the problems that NSX solved for them specifically, rather than being datacenter transformation/cloud journey stories that included NSX. For me, it felt like there was nothing new in the presentation that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been covered in the general sessions.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression. And NSX is a rocket-ship that is gathering speed and momentum, it&amp;rsquo;s viewed by many as critical to the future of VMware as the public cloud begins to eat the more traditional datacenter. With so much focus on NSX at VMworld this year, I am convinced of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title> #vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 3 – What’s New with vROps 6.6</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-3-whats-new-with-vrops-6-6/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2017 06:52:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-3-whats-new-with-vrops-6-6/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;[&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;vRealize Operations Manager 6.6&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, which was recently released by VMware.&lt;/p&gt;

The distributed model still has a single Identity Appliance but clusters 2 or more vCAC appliances behind a load balancer, backed by a separate vPostgres database appliance. The IaaS components are installed on 2 or more IaaS Windows servers and are load balanced, backed by an external MSSQL database.

If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SRM Authentication&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). Where the process fails is during the “configure connection” stage, if either one of your vCenter servers does not have CA signed and the other does (throws an error that they are using different authentication methods) or that you are using self-signed certificates for either SRM installation (throws an error that the certificate or CA could not be trusted).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCSA 5.5 Web Client fails to log on with &amp;ldquo;SSL certificate verification failed&amp;rdquo;</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This had me scratching my head, what seemed to be a common problem wasn’t fixed by the common solution.

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured that I’d stick to the Intel NUC route that I’ve gone down for &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/lab/" title="Lab"&gt;my lab&lt;/a&gt; at home – I love the NUC for its tiny form factor, silent operation and really low power consumption. There are down sides – it can only take 16GB RAM, only one mSATA disk and only has one gigabit NIC. I don’t think any of those are too big a deal for a personal lab though – certainly I’ve not had any problems building and testing VMware products on my single NUC. I’d drop in an 8GB stick of RAM and an Intel 60GB mSATA SSD per NUC – you could always go 16GB later by adding another 8GB stick in the 2nd slot. I picked the Intel mSATA disk for it’s controller and throughput figures – there are larger and cheaper ones but not with the same write performance. Since the use of SSD is massively in focus with vFlash, PernixData FVP and several other technologies, you wouldn’t want to miss out. I’ve also added an 8GB USB3 flash drive per NUC to boot ESXi from.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCAP5-DCA &amp;ndash; Achievement Unlocked!

&lt;p&gt;Digging around on google the error seemed to be related to over-allocating vCPUs (e.g. assigning 8 vCPUs on a VM with 4 physical CPU cores). This was a single vCPU machine on a 12 processor host, so not likely to be that! It did give me the idea that maybe the VMX had an error, so I edited the VM hardware and added an extra CPU and saved the config.

On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain. The SSO admin account (admin@System-Domain) is a part of that domain and so my guess is that the installer tries to authenticate using &lt;a href="mailto:admin@definit.local"&gt;admin@definit.local&lt;/a&gt; rather than System-Domain, which of course failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DataStore conflicts with an existing DataStore in the DataCenter – Manually disabling Storage I/O Control</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 15:31:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;I ran into this issue yesterday while reconnecting hosts in our vCenter Server following a complete reinstall - the reasons for which are a long story, but suffice to say that there were new certificates and the host passwords were encrypted with the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;

The script sets the server to Maintenance mode first, evacuating any VMs if you are in a full DRS automated environment.

Except you can’t, the feature is no-where to be seen. Something to bear in mind though, your OS needs to support hot-add, so you’ll need a Windows Enterprise or Datacenter edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to enable it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrade the VM’s tools, if you haven’t already. This requires a re-boot, but don’t reboot, shut the server down down, otherwise you’ll require another reboot to add the feature. The tools can be upgraded from the system tray icon.&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/image_thumb_27.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Migrating VMware Virtual Infrastructure 3 HA Cluster to vSphere 4 – Stage 1: vCenter Upgrade</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/11/migrating-vmware-virtual-infrastructure-3-ha-cluster-to-vsphere-4-%E2%80%93-stage-1-vcenter-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2009 17:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/11/migrating-vmware-virtual-infrastructure-3-ha-cluster-to-vsphere-4-%E2%80%93-stage-1-vcenter-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of migrating a 2-host High Availability cluster of ESX 3.5u4 servers to vSphere 4.
