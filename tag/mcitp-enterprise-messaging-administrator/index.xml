I am especially pleased with the score on the PRO exam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, there’s quite a lot of overlap between the two exams, with the more heavily theory and design based PRO exam being a “high-level” of the more hands-on management and cmdlet based TS exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
