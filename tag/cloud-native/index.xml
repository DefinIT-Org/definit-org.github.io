The whole Kubernetes ecosystem is a vast and nebulous beast, with new projects rising to the fore all the time, and old projects fading from favour.

This allows me to use Storage Policy to create Persistent Volumes based on policy. For example, Iâ€™m going to create two classes of storage, Fast and Slow - Fast will be vSAN based and Slow will be NFS based.</description></item></channel></rss>
