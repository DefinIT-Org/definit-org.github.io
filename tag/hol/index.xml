The first data center residing in Slough with more data centers planned across Europe in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an SME that has several existing vSphere environments this was of real interest, as the need to scale out quickly from our Private clouds is rapidly becoming a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already spoken to VMware on the phone to get a rough idea on options and costs I decided to take a look at the &lt;a href="http://labs.hol.vmware.com/" title="Hands on Labs"&gt;Hands-on-labs&lt;/a&gt; to see how easy it really is to use and migrate VMs from an existing private cloud to vCHS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
