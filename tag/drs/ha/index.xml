I added new ESXi 5 host to a cluster today and spent a good couple of hours troubleshooting the error:
vSphere HA agent for host [Host&amp;rsquo;s Name] has an error in [Cluster&amp;rsquo;s Name] in [Datacenter&amp;rsquo;s Name]: vSphere HA agent cannot be correctly installed or configured After a few basic checks, migrating the host in and out of the cluster and rebooting, I headed off to google and began troubleshooting.</description></item><item><title>VMware vSphere – DRS only shows one host in cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/05/vmware-vsphere-drs-only-shows-one-host-in-cluster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2010 15:54:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/05/vmware-vsphere-drs-only-shows-one-host-in-cluster/</guid><description>I rebuilt an ESX host in my HA/DRS cluster today, following my build procedure to configure as per VMware best practices and internal guidelines. When the host was fully configured and up-to-date, I added it to the cluster and enabled HA and DRS. Then I went to generate some DRS recommendations to balance the load an ease off my overstretched host, but no recommendations were made.
I couldn’t manually migrate any VMs either – it was odd, because both hosts were added into the cluster, and could ping and vmkping each other from the console.</description></item></channel></rss>
