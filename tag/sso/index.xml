This walk through goes through the deployment and configuration of the vCAC Identity Appliance, which provides a stand alone SSO instance for vCAC.
Some of the posts in this series are completed with vCAC 6.0.1, others will be with 6.1. Where there are differences I will aim to point them out!
Deploying the OVF Deploying the OVF is very simple, just run through the wizard:</description></item><item><title>Avoid SSO Admin lockout &amp;ndash; a.k.a. your first task after installing vSphere SSO</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/11/avoid-sso-admin-lockout-a-k-a-your-first-task-after-installing-vsphere-sso/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Nov 2013 12:55:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/11/avoid-sso-admin-lockout-a-k-a-your-first-task-after-installing-vsphere-sso/</guid><description>In my post yesterday (vexpert.me/hS) I talked about how to recover from an expired default SSO administrator password – this prompted a discussion on twitter with Anthony Spiteri (@anthonyspiteri) and Grant Orchard (@grantorchard) about the defaults for expiration and how to mitigate the risk.
The first solution is to modify the password expiration policy for SSO. I’m not advocating this necessarily – I think that expiring passwords ensure that you change them regularly and increase the overall security of your SSO solution.</description></item><item><title>London VMUG &amp;ndash; July 2013</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/07/london-vmug-july-2013/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2013 12:54:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/07/london-vmug-july-2013/</guid><description>Yesterday I attended my second ever #LonVMUG and did my first ever VMUG presentation! Generally it was a great day, with loads of really good sessions and some really cool community and vendor content.
As ever it was great day for socialising and networking with people who you interact with on twitter. For me one of the major benefits of the VMUG is learning from other people’s experience. Twitter was alive with the hastag #LonVMUG and it definitely adds something to the day to be active</description></item><item><title>VMware vCenter Linked Mode not supported through firewalls</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/vmware-vcenter-linked-mode-not-supported-through-firewalls/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Feb 2013 15:28:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/vmware-vcenter-linked-mode-not-supported-through-firewalls/</guid><description>This article originally started off life as a record of how I managed to get this working, as a lot of my posts do, but this time it appears I am foiled.
Last week, I had 3 vCenter Servers that appeared to be happily talking to each other in Linked Mode sharing a singe Multi-site SSO domain without any real issues. I had a single-pane-of-glass view of all 3 and I could manage them all from the one client.</description></item><item><title>vCenter 5.1 Single Sign On Multi-Site error: User credentials are incorrect or empty</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcenter-5-1-single-sign-on-multi-site-error-user-credentials-are-incorrect-or-empty/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Nov 2012 20:24:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcenter-5-1-single-sign-on-multi-site-error-user-credentials-are-incorrect-or-empty/</guid><description>While adding an additional vCenter Server to our Multi-Site Single Sign On instance I encountered a problem as I entered the details of the existing SSO.
The error thrown was:
User credentials are incorrect or empty. Provide correct credentials.
After a couple of hours online with VMware support I took a guess at the problem. On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain.</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware vSphere Single Sign On (SSO) in Multi-site Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/installing-vmware-vsphere-single-sign-on-sso-in-multi-site-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 19:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/installing-vmware-vsphere-single-sign-on-sso-in-multi-site-mode/</guid><description>VMware vSphere Single Sign On (SSO) can be installed in Multi-site mode to support local sign-on to vCenters that you want to be part of the same single sign on domain - for example, if you want to install Linked-Mode and have the advantage of a single pane of glass view, but can&amp;rsquo;t risk using a single SSO instance across the WAN.
