One of the aspects I enjoyed the most about that event was being able to chat to many well known and familiar faces from the wider community.
In this recent event there was a lot of focus on the various offerings from VMware with a good deal of focus on VSAN, NSX, Horizon and vCHS but certainly not neglecting their other offerings.</description></item></channel></rss>
