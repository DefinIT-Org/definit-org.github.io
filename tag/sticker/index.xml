&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I entered a &lt;a href="https://www.stickermule.com/"&gt;StickerMule&lt;/a&gt; tweet contest to get some free holographic sticker prints - and I won! While I was thinking about what to do with my newly donated sticker trove, I figured why not use it to bribe the vExpert community in exchange for some charitable giving?! And, given there were over 50 likes and 40 comments in response to my initial tweet, it seemed like vExperts were up for a little bit of paying it forward!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
