 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; GA today
&lt;/a&gt; and from what I have seen so far I do think VSAN is a great product and I think VMware have done a superb job with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-many-&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; discussions on twitter and other channels regarding the then lack of licensing information and pricing I was eager to see if VMware would offer a &amp;ldquo;foundation&amp;rdquo; VSAN option for SMB/SME&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Online Archiving with Exchange 2010? Can&amp;rsquo;t see your Online Archive in Outlook?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/online-archiving-with-exchange-2010-cant-see-your-online-archive-in-outlook/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2011 12:37:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/online-archiving-with-exchange-2010-cant-see-your-online-archive-in-outlook/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/02/Exchange-2010-Logo-748516_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently managed several Exchange 2010 migration projects, one of the best new features which really sells it to systems administrators is the Online Archive. “No more managing PST files? When can we have it installed by?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, once they’ve purchased licensing for Exchange 2010 and installed and configured the server, migrated the users’ mailboxes and decommissioned the old Exchange 2003 server, the Online Archive feature is not available. The users have been enabled, and as of SP1 we have a separate Archive mailbox database configured on slow (cheap) storage, but the Online Archive is nowhere to be found in Outlook. If the users log on using OWA, lo and behold the Online Archive is available.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
