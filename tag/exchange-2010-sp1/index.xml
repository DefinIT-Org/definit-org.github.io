It’s also useful if you just don’t have the capacity on your main storage.</description></item><item><title>Installing Exchange 2010 SP1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/installing-exchange-2010-sp1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 11:23:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/installing-exchange-2010-sp1/</guid><description>Exchange SP1 has now been released, so I thought I’d document the upgrade process for my small Exchange 2010 organisation, consisting of one CAS/Transport/Mailbox server, and an Edge Transport server.

For that you need to look at what’s new in Exchange 2010 SP1, the release notes and prerequisites. Finally, the installation instructions for upgrading from Exchange 2010 RTM to SP1.</description></item></channel></rss>
