This time around, Sunny and I spoke about the latest release of vRealize Operations Manager. We spoke about almost all the new features which were introduced with this version and went into some of them in detail. Like always we rounded up the session with Live Demo of the new features for our audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduced a feedback form which can be used to provide your feedback in general and also request topics on which you would want us to focus this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.5 – Two new enhancements/features I really liked</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 08:37:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/03/vrops-6-5-two-new-enhancementsfeatures-i-really-liked/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;So vROps 6.5 has been out for around a month now and I finally have a little while to write a post on what I personally really like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of great new enhancements and improvements added in 6.5 but for the sake of brevity I shall highlight two that I really liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="flexibility-to-increase-ram-in-between-node-sizes"&gt;Flexibility to increase RAM in between node sizes &lt;a class="anchor" href="#flexibility-to-increase-ram-in-between-node-sizes"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are familiar with vROps you will know that when you deploy it you have &amp;ldquo;T-Shirt&amp;rdquo; sizes to choose from, Small, Medium, Large and now Extra Large (6.5). However an additional extra in 6.5 is support to increase the memory allocation of your vROps nodes, you will not require additional CPU for the node until you hit the next node size bracket. If in doubt check the &lt;a href="https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2093783" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; sizing guide spreadsheet
&lt;/a&gt; VMware has provided so you can be sure on what you can and cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
