&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vSphere 5.5, VMware dropped the drivers for quite a few consumer grade NICs - in 6 they&amp;rsquo;ve gone a step further and actually blocked quite a few of these using a VIB package.

The host in question was an IBM x3650 M3, an excellent workhorse for virtualisation and one of 5 or 6 of the same model that I’ve installed in the last year. In addition to the onboard Broadcom Dual Gigabit NIC, we always install at least a second Intel PCIx Dual Gigabit card for resilience/redundancy/performance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
