One such requirement recently specified triple DES password based encryption as the standard, which led me through a lot of Google searches to CryptoJS.
CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.</description></item></channel></rss>
