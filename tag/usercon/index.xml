&lt;p&gt;The vCurry event was excellent and it was a great chance to enjoy good food in great company. Had the chance to meet with many people I would not normally get the chance to see, Frank &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbuechsel"&gt;@fbuechsel&lt;/a&gt; and Brad &lt;a href="mailto:V@VMUG_CEO"&gt;@VMUG_CEO&lt;/a&gt; to name a couple! To top off a really great evening we (my table/team) won the vQuiz which was organised and conducted by Stuart &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Virtual_Stu"&gt;@Virtual_Stu&lt;/a&gt; (thanks Stuart!), a big thank you to Matt &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twickersmatt"&gt;@Twickersmatt&lt;/a&gt; for the beers (one of the prizes).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
