PKS with NSX-T is a really hot topic right now and I think it’s going to be a big part of the future CNA landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Lab PKS 1.0.4 deployment is configured as a &amp;ldquo;NO-NAT with Logical Switch (NSX-T) Topology” as depicted in the diagram below (from the PKS documentation). My setup has these network characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: Intro to NSX-T Architecture #NET1510BE and NSX-T and Kubernetes #NET1522BE</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-intro-to-nsx-t-architecture-net1510be-and-nsx-t-and-kubernetes-net1522be/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 11:23:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-intro-to-nsx-t-architecture-net1510be-and-nsx-t-and-kubernetes-net1522be/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be no surprise, given &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/the-next-big-thing/"&gt;my impending move to the VMware PSO NSX Practice&lt;/a&gt;, that this morning I&amp;rsquo;ve been focussing on NSX-T. The two sessions I attended were the Introduction to NSX-T Architecture and Integrating NSX-T with Kubernetes. In a weird twist of scheduling, the Kubernetes session was before the introduction session, but it worked out OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the Kubernetes session really enjoyable and really felt like the speakers delivered a great overview of the integration and how they work together. I was pleasantly surprised with how fami&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;liar a lot of the concepts were, coming from an NSX-v and vRealize Automation background. It&amp;rsquo;s similar, but different! This is something I can really get my teeth into.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Speed of Change in IT Infrastructure (Opinion)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/the-speed-of-change-in-it-infrastructure-opinion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2017 09:34:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/the-speed-of-change-in-it-infrastructure-opinion/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/02/The-Flash-FanPop.jpg" alt=""&gt;Over the past 6 months I have been dwelling more and more on the obvious speed of change and development in IT Infrastructure. What do I mean? Well each year there is the new hotness, the next thing/innovation you are told you need or should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the innovations and new tech are ground breaking awesomeness and most certainly offer new opportunities for the infrastructure masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for progress, if you are not moving forward and regularly looking for sensible ways to improve what you do and the infrastructure you use then I really do think you are in the wrong industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRA7.2 and vSphere Integrated Containers</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vra7-2-and-vsphere-integrated-containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2016 15:28:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vra7-2-and-vsphere-integrated-containers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;One of the cool new features released with vRealize Automation 7.2 was the integration of VMware Admiral (container management) into the product, and recently VMware made version 1 of vSphere Integrated Containers generally available (GA), so I thought it was time I started playing around with the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;m going to cover deploying VIC to my vSphere environment and then adding that host to the vRA 7.2 container management.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
