With the next instalment of this series, we have a new speaker who will entertain us ðŸ™‚ He is no stranger to the world of vRealize Operations Manager and has written a couple of books on vROps as well. I am referring to Iwan Rahabok who has been my partner in crime on all the vROps related work which we do, inside VMware or with the community.</description></item></channel></rss>
