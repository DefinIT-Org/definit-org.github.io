They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.
One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card.</description></item></channel></rss>
