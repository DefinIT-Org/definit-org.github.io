One such requirement recently specified triple DES password based encryption as the standard, which led me through a lot of Google searches to &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/"&gt;CryptoJS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
