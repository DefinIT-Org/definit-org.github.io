It was recently brought to my attention that Oracle Cloud have a free tier offering (that they promise is always free) that includes two AMD-based compute VMs with 1/8th of an CPU and 1GB RAM (not much use to anyone) and (much more interestingly) a 4 Arm-based Ampere A1 cores and 24GB usable RAM as 1-4 VMs.</description></item></channel></rss>
