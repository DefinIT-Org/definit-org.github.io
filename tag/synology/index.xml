They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.
One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card.</description></item><item><title>What sort of lab would you build for $2000?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/what-sort-of-lab-would-you-build-for-2000/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 10:39:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/what-sort-of-lab-would-you-build-for-2000/</guid><description>John Troyer (@jtroyer) asked a question on Twitter last night about a CloudCred prize of $1000-2000:
@jtroyer a nice lab setup! — Sam McGeown (@sammcgeown) September 19, 2013 @jtroyer I guess a couple of hosts, storage and a switch, wouldn't get HCL certified for that but I'm sure it's doable! — Sam McGeown (@sammcgeown) September 19, 2013  That got me thinking – was it possible to create an entire 2 host lab with storage on a $2000 budget?</description></item></channel></rss>
