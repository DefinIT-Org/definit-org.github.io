The workload servers are noisy and power hungry so they tend to be powered off when I am not using them, and since they live in my garage, I power them on and off remotely.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO) and vCloud Director – fixing bugs in "Add a vDC"</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco-and-vcloud-director-fixing-bugs-in-add-a-vdc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 10:53:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco-and-vcloud-director-fixing-bugs-in-add-a-vdc/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;When you are using a VMware orchestration platform with an official VMware plugin to manage a VMware product, you don&amp;rsquo;t really expect to have to fix the out-of-the-box workflows. However, during some testing of some workflows with a client the other day we ran into a couple of issues with the vCloud Director plugin workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software versions used&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vCloud Director 5.5.1 (appliance for development) and 5.5.2 (production deployment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vRealize Orchestrator Appliance 5.5.2.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vCloud Director plugin 5.5.1.2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cpu-allocations-are-incorrect-for-both-add-a-vdc"&gt;CPU allocations are incorrect for both &amp;ldquo;Add a VDC&amp;rdquo; &lt;a class="anchor" href="#cpu-allocations-are-incorrect-for-both-add-a-vdc"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you provide the CPU allocation model properties for the Allocation Pool model the first problem is decrypting the naming - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t match the names in the vCloud Director interface!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator (vCO) Multi-node Plug-in use case: Remote Site Selection and Execution</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-operations-vco-multi-node-plug-in-use-case-remote-site-selection-and-execution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 16:46:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-operations-vco-multi-node-plug-in-use-case-remote-site-selection-and-execution/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;One of the use cases I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on with a customer is based on the vRO/vCO multi-node plug-in and involves the master vRO/vCO node calling proxy workflows based on a parameter - in this case the target site. As you can see from this very simple diagram, a Cloud Management System (CMS) calls a workflow on the Master node, which then executes a proxy workflow on the correct site. The trick is getting the Master Orchestrator node to pick the right proxy workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Backing up ESXi 5.5 host configurations with vCenter Orchestrator (vCO) &amp;ndash; Workflow design walkthrough</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/backing-up-esxi-5-5-host-configurations-with-vcenter-orchestrator-vco-workflow-design-walkthrough/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2014 16:27:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/backing-up-esxi-5-5-host-configurations-with-vcenter-orchestrator-vco-workflow-design-walkthrough/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;As a little learning project, I thought I’d take on &lt;a href="http://vexpert.me/kd"&gt;Simon’s previous post&lt;/a&gt; about backing up ESXi configurations and extend it to vCenter Orchestrator (vCO), and document how I go about building up a workflow. I&amp;rsquo;m learning more and more about vCO all the time, but I found it has a really steep entry point, and finding use cases is hard if you haven&amp;rsquo;t explored capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps I want to create in this post are:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
