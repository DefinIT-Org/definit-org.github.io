It is an import limitation to be aware of if you plan to adjust your pNIC configuration of any VCF hosts post deployment/commisioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem &lt;a class="anchor" href="#the-problem"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a few customers who will not be able to commision their new hosts with the desired pNIC configuration due to current hardware availability. The availability of the pNICs due to global supply challenges has meant severe delays in availability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCF 4.4 Design Considerations</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/03/vcf-4.4-design-considerations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/03/vcf-4.4-design-considerations/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On the 10th February VCF 4.4 was released, this was quite a significant milestone as it removed a few things from the equation and also provided more flexbility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly and arguably the big change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of VMware Validated Designs tyically you would use Remote Collectors not just in different DCs but also local to the analytics cluster. However there are a circumstances where the rules &amp;ldquo;change&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

Both Sunny and I successfully delivered the session on Design and Deployment considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Session Details:-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In this instalment of the series, we discussed the steps and thought processes that should be used before and during the design and deployment of vRealize Operations Manager. During the session among other things we will cover the planning, core components, correct sizing, HA, clustering, DR and future growth**.**&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 5 : Design &amp; Deployment Considerations</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-5-design-deployment-considerations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2016 06:52:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-5-design-deployment-considerations/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;Time to announce the next part of the year long &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/starting-2016-with-a-bang-vrops-webinar-series/" target="_blank"&gt;

 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; Sunny
&lt;/a&gt; and I thought about discussing Architecture of vROps. To some, it might sound strange as for smaller deployments you might not have to worry about Sizing and Architecture much since it is pretty simple to install and configure a small or a medium node for a small shop. However as your monitoring needs grow and you start adding solutions for monitoring data sources beyond vSphere, you would need to think about scaling up or scaling out. As your monitoring environment weaves into your incident ticketing system, you would start to see the need to HA of vROps and as you have a DR strategy for your workloads, you will start thinking about DR for your operations tools as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Is there any #vROps reference architecture?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/is-there-any-vrops-reference-architecture/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2016 12:17:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/is-there-any-vrops-reference-architecture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Given the flexibility in which you can choose to use and deploy vROps a question that frequently comes out is “is there a best practice?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While that phrase is getting pretty tired it is still valid if you are just starting a design for a new vROps build or trying to make the best of a bad implementation. Rather than me trying to tell you how you should use vROps in your place of work I would direct you to a very useful PDF VMware have produced vRealize Operations Manager &lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/vrealizeoperationsmanager-62/index.jsp#com.vmware.vcom.core.doc/GUID-F683DD38-D960-48A8-B1AA-D60222C78F51.html?resultof=%2522%2572%2565%2566%2565%2572%2565%256e%2563%2565%2522%2520%2522%2572%2565%2566%2565%2572%2522%2520" target="_blank"&gt;
