If
you are using Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 2007
and
you have a Microsoft Certificate Services 2003 Certificate Authority on your domain
and
you have non-domain Windows Server 2008 servers you wish to monitor or set up as a gateway server.
Getting a certificate for either a Gateway Server or remotely monitored Server can be a touch vexing.</description></item><item><title>Event IDs 1030 and 1058 on Server 2003 Domain Controller</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/03/event-ids-1030-and-1058-on-server-2003-domain-controller/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Mar 2010 10:30:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/03/event-ids-1030-and-1058-on-server-2003-domain-controller/</guid><description>I logged onto a production domain controller this morning and checked the event logs to be confronted with this:
Event ID 1030 and 1058 every 5 minutes, looking into the detail for these events I can see its a replication issue for one of the GPOs.

My problem when I tried to verify that the fixed DNS setup had propogated around my domain controllers, DC01 and DC02. DC01 kept failing &amp;ldquo;DCDIAG /TEST:DNS&amp;rdquo; with errors regarding the root hint servers. Googling about it was clear that a lot of people were suffering the same issue, but no article I read had correctly identified the solution.</description></item><item><title>Multi-homed Domain controller logs Event ID 1030 and 1058</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/09/multi-homed-domain-controller-logs-event-id-1030-and-1058/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2009 12:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/09/multi-homed-domain-controller-logs-event-id-1030-and-1058/</guid><description>I recently had an issue where a hosting environment was registering a lot of Netlogon Event 1030/1058 issues, being unable to find the Group Policy objects or download them.

Unfortunately this policy was accidently linked to the root of our domain too, causing our Domain Admin users to be redirected too - something we do not want. When the mistake was discovered, the policy was unlinked, but the redirection remained (despite being set to revert when users fall out of scope).</description></item><item><title>Powershell script to zip all .bak files in a folder structure, then delete the .bak</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/01/powershell-script-to-zip-all-bak-files-in-a-folder-structure-then-delete-the-bak/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 12:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/01/powershell-script-to-zip-all-bak-files-in-a-folder-structure-then-delete-the-bak/</guid><description>Our development SQL server is a monster…there are many many databases, and hundreds, if not thousands of backup files. With each patch tested on the software we sell, there is a new backup. With each client deployment, a new database. With each new major version, a new database. Backups of the new databases inevitably occur, and so we have more files, in more folders - most of which need to be kept in case of roll-backs, bugs or deployment issues.</description></item><item><title>Windows update or installer fails to install with error “You do not have permission to update Windows Server 2003.

The specifications of the new server which are &amp;ldquo;required&amp;rdquo; to qualify for support are pretty high. The problem is that the actual processor usage is very light, and it is very hard to justify buying a whole new server that I know is going to be barely used.</description></item><item><title>Adding a Windows 2003 domain controller to your existing Windows 2000 domain</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/adding-a-windows-2003-domain-controller-to-your-existing-windows-2000-domain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Apr 2008 16:20:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/adding-a-windows-2003-domain-controller-to-your-existing-windows-2000-domain/</guid><description>I was adding a shiny new domain controller to my server farm earlier today, we have just two Windows 2000 SP4 domain controllers on old kit and they&amp;nbsp;are due to retire.

The roles were migrating to a newer server, far more up to the job, but it isn’t a job to be taken lightly. If you mess up the root domain, you’ve potentially got problems all the way down your domain hierarchy.
&amp;nbsp; Let me explain; the primary domain controller in a domain (normally the first domain controller) hosts all the FSMO roles.</description></item><item><title>I’m qualified!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/10/i%E2%80%99m-qualified/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Oct 2007 19:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/10/i%E2%80%99m-qualified/</guid><description>It’s been a while since I’ve posted here, that’s for various reasons, one of which was that I have been preparing for, and taking, my MCSA exams.
