One of the limitations that caused headaches was that it used to have a maximum storage of 4GB, which was the database limit. If you wanted to go larger, you would need either a) multiple SPS installations, b) a full version of SQL server, or c) the full version of MOSS. None of those solutions are particularly cost effective, and for a small company cost is king.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
