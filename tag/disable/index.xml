Would they need a management pack or is this something vROps can do out of the box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer to this is yes, but it is not immediately obvious how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great many metrics that come with a vanilla build of vROps but not all of them are enabled a good example of these are the sensor metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
