For the last year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been running all my home kubernetes workloads on a Raspberry Pi cluster - and it&amp;rsquo;s been working really well!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been through several iterations - for example firstly running on SD cards (tl;dr - it&amp;rsquo;s bad, they wear out really fast with Kubernetes on board!), then PxE booting them from my Synology to it&amp;rsquo;s now current state of booting directly from SSDs.</description></item><item><title>PXE Booting Raspberry Pi 4 with Synology and Ubiquiti EdgeRouter</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/pxe-booting-raspberry-pi-4-with-synology-and-ubiquiti-edgerouter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/pxe-booting-raspberry-pi-4-with-synology-and-ubiquiti-edgerouter/</guid><description>I love Raspbery Pis - I have done since they first released them, all the way up to the present iteration, the Raspberry Pi 4. They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.
One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card.</description></item></channel></rss>
