UMDS is tool you can install to download patches (and third party VIBs - I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that) for Update Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for environments that don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or air-gapped, and also for environments with multiple vCenter Servers where you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to download the same patch on every server.</description></item><item><title>Migrating VMware Virtual Infrastructure 3 HA Cluster to vSphere 4 â€“ Stage 1: vCenter Upgrade</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/11/migrating-vmware-virtual-infrastructure-3-ha-cluster-to-vsphere-4-%E2%80%93-stage-1-vcenter-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2009 17:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/11/migrating-vmware-virtual-infrastructure-3-ha-cluster-to-vsphere-4-%E2%80%93-stage-1-vcenter-upgrade/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently in the process of migrating a 2-host High Availability cluster of ESX 3.5u4 servers to vSphere 4. This is going to come in 3 distinct stages: Stage 1 is to upgrade VirtualCenter Server 2.5 to vCenter 4, which I am going to cover today. Stage 2 is to upgrade each host, and will be covered as I do it. Stage 3 is the upgrade of the Virtual Machines to the latest VMware Tools and then the new VM hardware.</description></item></channel></rss>
