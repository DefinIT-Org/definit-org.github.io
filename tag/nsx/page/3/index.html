This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic. Then second reason is throughput - each NSX Edge is capable of ~10Gbps throughput, but with ECMP we can have multiple NSX Edges (up to 8) providing 10Gbps each - that&rsquo;s a significant performance boost.</p></div></div><div class=card-footer><a class=card-link href=https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/01/deploying-ecmp-for-nsx-provider-logical-router/>More</a></div></div></div><div class="clr-col-12 clr-col-sm-12 clr-col-md-12 clr-col-lg-6 clr-col-xl-6"><div class=card><div class=card-header style=height:74px><a href=https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-vrealize-automation-7-briefing-notes/>#VMworld2015: vRealize Automation 7 Briefing Notes</a></div><div class=card-block><div class=card-media-block><div class="card-media-desciption clr-card-authors"><span class="card-media-title clr-card-authors"><div class=clr-card-authors><img src=/images/SamMcGeown2020.jpg alt class=img-author>Written by <a href=https://www.definit.co.uk/authors/sam-mcgeown/>Sam McGeown</a>
