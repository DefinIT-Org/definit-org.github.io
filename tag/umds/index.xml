UMDS is tool you can install to download patches (and third party VIBs - I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that) for Update Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for environments that don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or air-gapped, and also for environments with multiple vCenter Servers where you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to download the same patch on every server.</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware vSphere Update Manager Download Service and publishing via IIS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/installing-vmware-vsphere-update-manager-download-service-and-publishing-via-iis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:30:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/installing-vmware-vsphere-update-manager-download-service-and-publishing-via-iis/</guid><description>The vSphere UMDS provides a way to download patches for VMware servers that have an air-gap, or for some reason aren’t allowed to go out to the internet themselves – in my case a security policy prevented a DMZ vCenter Server from connecting to the internet directly. The solution is to use UMDS to download the updates to a 2nd server that was hosted in the DMZ and then update the vCenter Server from there.</description></item></channel></rss>
