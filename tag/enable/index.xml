Would they need a management pack or is this something vROps can do out of the box?
The short answer to this is yes, but it is not immediately obvious how.
There are a great many metrics that come with a vanilla build of vROps but not all of them are enabled aÂ good example of these are the sensor metrics.</description></item><item><title>What if I want full metrics? in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</guid><description>If you have used vCOps (previous version of vROPs) you will likely remember the option in the admin panel where you could change the number of metrics being collected from &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo;.
As many found, this option drop down was not present in vROps and there appeared to be no replacement.
Here is the good news, the ability to collect those metrics has not been removed rather it&amp;rsquo;s just a little more hidden (by design)</description></item></channel></rss>
