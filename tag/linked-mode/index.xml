Last week, I had 3 vCenter Servers that appeared to be happily talking to each other in Linked Mode sharing a singe Multi-site SSO domain without any real issues.

In other words, from VMware&amp;rsquo;s blog post:
Multisite deployments areÂ where a local replica is maintained at remote sites of the primary vCenter Single Sign-On instance.</description></item></channel></rss>
