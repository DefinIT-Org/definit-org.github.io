I did a brief search on the web to see what material was &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; on how to perform what is a straight forward task. To my surprise very little came up. So I have decided to create this guide with all the things you need to consider when you are going to either expand or need to remove a node from one of your active vROps deployments.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DataStore conflicts with an existing DataStore in the DataCenter – Manually disabling Storage I/O Control</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 15:31:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;I ran into this issue yesterday while reconnecting hosts in our vCenter Server following a complete reinstall - the reasons for which are a long story, but suffice to say that there were new certificates and the host passwords were encrypted with the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LUNs had been unpresented at the hardware level by the storage team, but had not been unmounted or removed from vCenter. This is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the way to remove storage - let me re-iterate: &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2011/11/best-practice-how-to-correctly-remove-a-lun-from-an-esx-host.html"&gt;remove storage properly&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately in this case the storage was removed badly - doing this can lead to a condition called &amp;ldquo;All Paths Down&amp;rdquo; or APD which is best explained by Cormac Hogan (@vmwarestorage) in the article &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2011/08/all-path-down-apd-handling-in-50.html"&gt;Handling the All Paths Down (APD) condition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
