&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Staying up until 3am to get the brisket on, so what do I do? Work on tuning up &lt;a href="https://t.co/YDiFkGIKLY"&gt;https://t.co/YDiFkGIKLY&lt;/a&gt; with some better &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VMwareClarity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VMwareClarity&lt;/a&gt; styling! Check out the differences below! Subtle changes but I think it&amp;#39;s a lot better. Thoughts? &lt;a href="https://t.co/6sYnuBahwI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6sYnuBahwI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Cody De Arkland (@Codydearkland) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Codydearkland/status/1008269216049291264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 17, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cody has gone down the route of using Hugo and AWS, which I respect, but just seems like too much work for me at the moment! I am familiar with WordPress, and Simon is barely computer literate at the best of times, so I can&amp;rsquo;t ask him to start writing in markdown. But I did want some of this Clarity goodness - so I set about learning how to create a WordPress theme, and how to integrate Clarity with this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>GDPR, blogging and DefinIT</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2018 20:46:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So…this is a frustrated sort of post. As you are most likely to already know, the new data protection laws (GDPR) are coming into effect on the 25th May 2018. I must emphasise that &lt;strong&gt;I am not an expert on GDPR&lt;/strong&gt;, this post is my layman’s conclusion for my specific circumstances. I run this blog as an exercise to help others, provide information and as a hobby. There is a lot of speculation around how this will affect bloggers, and a lot of panic and mis-information too. I’ve seen a few people this week simply shut down and delete their blogs - which is both upsetting and sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using the vExpert.me URL shortener and WordPress</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/using-the-vexpert-me-url-shortener-and-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2013 15:30:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/using-the-vexpert-me-url-shortener-and-wordpress/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;One of the many perks of being a vExpert is the cool vexpert.me URL shortener provided by Darren Woollard (@dawoo).

One of the major drivers for me as a “Microsoft” person was to use something that is based on Microsoft technology – &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;BlogEngine.Net&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; is based (as the name suggests) on the .Net framework. I’m much happier these days writing limited amounts of C#.Net than I am with PHP.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
