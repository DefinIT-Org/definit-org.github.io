Staying up until 3am to get the brisket on, so what do I do? Work on tuning up https://t.co/YDiFkGIKLY with some better @VMwareClarity styling! Check out the differences below! Subtle changes but I think it&amp;#39;s a lot better. Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/6sYnuBahwI
&amp;mdash; Cody De Arkland (@Codydearkland) June 17, 2018 Cody has gone down the route of using Hugo and AWS, which I respect, but just seems like too much work for me at the moment!</description></item><item><title>GDPR, blogging and DefinIT</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 May 2018 20:46:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/05/gdpr-blogging-and-definit/</guid><description>So…this is a frustrated sort of post. As you are most likely to already know, the new data protection laws (GDPR) are coming into effect on the 25th May 2018. I must emphasise that I am not an expert on GDPR, this post is my layman’s conclusion for my specific circumstances. I run this blog as an exercise to help others, provide information and as a hobby. There is a lot of speculation around how this will affect bloggers, and a lot of panic and mis-information too.</description></item><item><title>Using the vExpert.me URL shortener and WordPress</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/using-the-vexpert-me-url-shortener-and-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Aug 2013 15:30:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/using-the-vexpert-me-url-shortener-and-wordpress/</guid><description>One of the many perks of being a vExpert is the cool vexpert.me URL shortener provided by Darren Woollard (@dawoo). There are several ways for vExperts to use it once they’ve signed up – there’s a PowerShell script by Jonathan Medd (@jonathanmedd) and Maish Saidel-Keesing (@maishsk) and now even a GUI interface based on the PowerShell.
One thing I wanted to do was to automate the short links for my WordPress installation, so before attempting to write a plugin myself I had a quick search for YOURLS, the software Darren uses to create access.</description></item><item><title>Updated to WordPress 3.0.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/updated-wordpress-3-0-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2010 16:26:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/updated-wordpress-3-0-1/</guid><description>Hardly seems newsworthy any more, with the Automatic Upgrade option on WordPress 2.7+, but I&amp;rsquo;ve just upgraded to WordPress 3.0.1</description></item><item><title>Why I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my blogging software from BlogEngine.Net to WordPress</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/why-ive-changed-my-bogging-software-from-blogengine-net-to-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 10:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/why-ive-changed-my-bogging-software-from-blogengine-net-to-wordpress/</guid><description>Up until now, I’ve been using BlogEngine.Net as my blogging platform, and up until now I’ve been relatively happy with using it. One of the major drivers for me as a “Microsoft” person was to use something that is based on Microsoft technology – BlogEngine.Net is based (as the name suggests) on the .Net framework. I’m much happier these days writing limited amounts of C#.Net than I am with PHP.</description></item></channel></rss>
