I did a brief search on the web to see what material was &amp;ldquo;out there&amp;rdquo; on how to perform what is a straightÂ forward task. To my surprise very little came up. So I have decided to create this guide with all the things you need to consider when you are going to either expand or need to remove a node from one of your active vROps deployments.</description></item></channel></rss>
