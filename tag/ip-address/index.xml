I think the problem occurred because the IP addresses were all changed and the VMs shut down, without time for the application to update the node IPs.
The symptoms:
The web interface was down, a netstat -ano | grep -i “443” showed the service was listening _service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes /var/log/loginsight/runtime.</description></item><item><title>Using PowerShell to add IP addresses to IIS7&amp;rsquo;s FTP IPv4 Address and Domain Restrictions</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/using-powershell-to-add-ip-addresses-to-iis7s-ftp-ipv4-address-and-domain-restrictions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2010 10:55:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/using-powershell-to-add-ip-addresses-to-iis7s-ftp-ipv4-address-and-domain-restrictions/</guid><description>Today I was configuring a new FTP server based on IIS7 (well, 7.5 technically as it’s a Server 2008 R2 host), and I wanted an easy way to add and remove allowed IP addresses based on either an XML config file or a CSV import. Customers’ IP addresses are added or removed regularly, but I didn’t want to have to update their details twice, once on the server and once in the documents.</description></item></channel></rss>
