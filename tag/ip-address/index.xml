I think the problem occurred because the IP addresses were all changed and the VMs shut down, without time for the application to update the node IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web interface was down, a &lt;em&gt;netstat -ano | grep -i “443”&lt;/em&gt; showed the service was listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/var/log/loginsight/runtime.log contains warning messages about “Cassandra cluster not ready yet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running /usr/lib/loginsight/application/lib/apache-cassandra-*/bin/nodetool status showed the two data nodes down (DN) and used the old IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the nodes were up with their new IP addresses, however Cassandra on the Master node was still looking for the old IP addresses for the Worker nodes. The Worker nodes were in a similar state, knowing their own new IP addresses but not being able to update the Master node because they didn’t have the Master node’s new IP address.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using PowerShell to add IP addresses to IIS7&amp;rsquo;s FTP IPv4 Address and Domain Restrictions</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/using-powershell-to-add-ip-addresses-to-iis7s-ftp-ipv4-address-and-domain-restrictions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2010 10:55:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/using-powershell-to-add-ip-addresses-to-iis7s-ftp-ipv4-address-and-domain-restrictions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Today I was configuring a new FTP server based on IIS7 (well, 7.5 technically as it’s a Server 2008 R2 host), and I wanted an easy way to add and remove allowed IP addresses based on either an XML config file or a CSV import. Customers’ IP addresses are added or removed regularly, but I didn’t want to have to update their details twice, once on the server and once in the documents.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
