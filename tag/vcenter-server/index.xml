UMDS is tool you can install to download patches (and third party VIBs - I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that) for Update Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for environments that don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or air-gapped, and also for environments with multiple vCenter Servers where you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to download the same patch on every server. You can control which patches you download (for example, limiting to ESXi 6.7+ only) and you can add third party Vendor repositories (e.g. Dell or HPE).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building a vRealize Automation NSX Lab on Ravello</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/building-a-vrealize-automation-nsx-lab-on-ravello/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2015 17:06:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/09/building-a-vrealize-automation-nsx-lab-on-ravello/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/09/image_thumb22.png" alt=""&gt;As a vExpert, I am blessed to get 1000 CPU hours access to Ravello&amp;rsquo;s awesome platform and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with the AutoLab deployments tailored for Ravello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first solution is to modify the password expiration policy for SSO.

As far as I can see there are no differences between lockdown more in 5.5 and 5.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Basics: Correctly decommissioning a vSphere Datastore</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-basics-correctly-decommissioning-a-vsphere-datastore/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2013 12:04:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/08/vsphere-basics-correctly-decommissioning-a-vsphere-datastore/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;You’d be surprised how many times I see datastore that’s just been un-presented from hosts rather than decommissioned correctly – in one notable case I saw a distributed switch crippled for a whole cluster because the datastore in question was being used to store the VDS configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the process that I follow to ensure datastores are decommissioned without any issues – they need to comply with these requirements&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mid-year thoughts</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/07/mid-year-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jul 2013 21:33:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/07/mid-year-thoughts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a really great year so far and incredibly busy (no complaints though!)&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware products have featured very high on my to-do list so far this year, with new hosting and DR solutions either completed or well underway. The simplicity, resilience and strength of vSphere never gets old!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also had the privilege to attend several London VMUG meetings all of which have been excellent! They have been superb opportunities to meet new people, put faces to Twitter names and learn more about current and forthcoming technologies orientated around visualization. If you have not had chance to get to one yet, do try, they are really worthwhile!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware vSphere Update Manager Download Service and publishing via IIS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/installing-vmware-vsphere-update-manager-download-service-and-publishing-via-iis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:30:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/installing-vmware-vsphere-update-manager-download-service-and-publishing-via-iis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The vSphere UMDS provides a way to download patches for VMware servers that have an air-gap, or for some reason aren’t allowed to go out to the internet themselves – in my case a security policy prevented a DMZ vCenter Server from connecting to the internet directly. The solution is to use UMDS to download the updates to a 2nd server that was hosted in the DMZ and then update the vCenter Server from there. It also can save on bandwidth if you’re running multiple vCenter Servers, which again was the case (though bandwidth isn’t really a constraint).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Updating ESXi Fibre Channel HBA Drivers via VMware Update Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 14:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware2.jpg" alt=""&gt;A problem reared it&amp;rsquo;s head over the weekend with one of our hosts&amp;rsquo; Fibre Channel HBAs negotiating it&amp;rsquo;s way down to 2GB, and consequently introducing massive latency for the LUNs behind it. Analysis showed that the drivers for the HBA were over a year out of date so the suggested fix from VMware was to update the drivers. This is fine to do manually for a few hosts, but would be a real pain for the 300+ hosts in the environment I manage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using the VMware SSL Certificate Automation Tool with a Microsoft Certificate Authority</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/04/using-the-vmware-ssl-certificate-automation-tool-with-a-microsoft-certificate-authority/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Apr 2013 14:38:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/04/using-the-vmware-ssl-certificate-automation-tool-with-a-microsoft-certificate-authority/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Updating vCenter Server certificates has always been a pain - it has only got worse with the sheer number of services that are running under vSphere 5.1 - each service requiring a unique certificate and to be installed in many complex steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I had 3 vCenter Servers that appeared to be happily talking to each other in Linked Mode sharing a singe Multi-site SSO domain without any real issues. I had a single-pane-of-glass view of all 3 and I could manage them all from the one client. The reason for the 3 vCenter servers was segregation of LAN and DMZ networks: vCenter001 was in the LAN, vCenter002 sat in DMZ1 and vCenter003 sat in DMZ2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing the VMware Support Assistant</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/01/installing-the-vmware-support-assistant/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jan 2013 14:25:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/01/installing-the-vmware-support-assistant/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;So VMware&amp;rsquo;s Support Assistant is pretty awesome and it&amp;rsquo;s free!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/11/SingleSignOnMultiSite.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error thrown was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User credentials are incorrect or empty. Provide correct credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/11/ErrorMessage.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours online with VMware support I took a guess at the problem. On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain. The SSO admin account (admin@System-Domain) is a part of that domain and so my guess is that the installer tries to authenticate using &lt;a href="mailto:admin@definit.local"&gt;admin@definit.local&lt;/a&gt; rather than System-Domain, which of course failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware vSphere Single Sign On (SSO) in Multi-site Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/installing-vmware-vsphere-single-sign-on-sso-in-multi-site-mode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 19:33:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/installing-vmware-vsphere-single-sign-on-sso-in-multi-site-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt; VMware vSphere Single Sign On (SSO) can be installed in Multi-site mode to support local sign-on to vCenters that you want to be part of the same single sign on domain - for example, if you want to install Linked-Mode and have the advantage of a single pane of glass view, but can&amp;rsquo;t risk using a single SSO instance across the WAN. In other words, from &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/09/vcenter-single-sign-on-part-1-what-is-vcenter-single-sign-on.html"&gt;VMware&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multisite deployments are  where a local replica is maintained at remote sites of the primary vCenter Single Sign-On instance. vCenter Servers are reconfigured to use the local vCenter Single Sign-On service and reduce authentication requests across the WAN. Multisite deployments do drop the support of single pane of glass views unless Linked Mode is utilized and multisite deployments are actually required to maintain Linked Mode configurations where roles, permissions and licenses are replicated between linked vCenter servers. Linked mode will re-enable single pane of glass views across multisite instances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vCenter 5.1 – Configuring vCenter Linked Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/vcenter-5-1-configuring-vcenter-linked-mode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2012 15:42:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/vcenter-5-1-configuring-vcenter-linked-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;One thing we have been meaning to do for a while but haven&amp;rsquo;t got round to is getting our Virtual Center Servers into &amp;ldquo;Linked&amp;rdquo; mode - essentially to provide a single pane of glass view of our entire virtual estate.

The &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; are organised into categories to &amp;ldquo;define how the tags can be applied to inventory objects&amp;rdquo;. The easiest way to think of the difference is that custom attributes are &amp;ldquo;free text&amp;rdquo; and the tags are statically defined properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wizard for converting custom attributes to tags, but it can get a bit confusing and is pretty poor - let me explain. We use four custom attributes in my current environment: CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Owner and ServiceType. CreatedBy contains the user ID of the person who created the VM, CreatedOn is the timestamp of when the VM was created, Owner is the Business Unit who own the server and ServiceType is the type of service - e.g. Active Directory, or SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The requested Storage VMotion would move a virtual machine’s disks without assigning the virtual machine a new home, but such a move is not supported on the source host</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/the-requested-storage-vmotion-would-move-a-virtual-machines-disks-without-assigning-the-virtual-machine-a-new-home-but-such-a-move-is-not-supported-on-the-source-host/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2009 14:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/the-requested-storage-vmotion-would-move-a-virtual-machines-disks-without-assigning-the-virtual-machine-a-new-home-but-such-a-move-is-not-supported-on-the-source-host/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m migrating some hosts off of an older storage LUN, but when I drag the disk to the new Datastore with the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SVMotion plug-in&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; the job fails with the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
