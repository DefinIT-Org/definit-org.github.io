Try saying that fast after a pint or two!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempting to register NSX to the Lookup Service would result in the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NSX Management Service operation failed.( Initialization of Admin Registration Service Provider failed. Root Cause: Error occurred while registration of lookup service, com.vmware.vim.vmomi.core.exception.CertificateValidationException: Server certificate chain not verified )&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere 6 Lab Upgrade – vCenter Orchestrator to vRealize Orchestrator</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/vsphere-6-lab-upgrade-vcenter-orchestrator-to-vrealize-orchestrator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2015 16:23:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/vsphere-6-lab-upgrade-vcenter-orchestrator-to-vrealize-orchestrator/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/07/vSphereLogo.png" alt=""&gt;I tested vSphere 6 quite intensively when it was in beta, but I didn’t ever upgrade my lab – basically because I need a stable environment to work on and I wasn’t sure that I could maintain that with the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be upgrading&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vCenter Server Appliance - currently 5.5 update 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vSphere Update Manager - currently 5.5 update 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 HP N54L resource hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Intel NUC management host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my lab I run various VMware software suites listed below, although I typically run them in nested environments to keep my lab install relatively clean.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere 6 Lab Upgrade – Upgrading ESXi 5.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/vsphere-6-lab-upgrade-upgrading-esxi-5-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 19:11:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/vsphere-6-lab-upgrade-upgrading-esxi-5-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/07/vSphereLogo.png" alt=""&gt;I tested vSphere 6 quite intensively when it was in beta, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t ever upgrade my lab - basically because I need a stable environment to work on and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure that I could maintain that with the beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vSphere 5.5, VMware dropped the drivers for quite a few consumer grade NICs - in 6 they&amp;rsquo;ve gone a step further and actually blocked quite a few of these using a VIB package.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download and mount the VMware-VCSA-all-6.0.0-2562643 ISO image (mounted as G:\ on my workstation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browse the ISO and run the Client Integration Plugin &amp;ldquo;G:\vcsa\VMware-ClientIntegrationPlugin-6.0.0.exe&amp;rdquo; - it&amp;rsquo;s a simple next, next finish sort of install.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
