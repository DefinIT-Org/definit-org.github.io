I&amp;rsquo;ve previously talked about using CoreDNS to host my lab DNS zones, but this is something different. I want to make a Kubernetes Service available using an existing Microsoft DNS server - which is already used by all the clients who would need to access the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this I will create a delegated zone under my existing zone &lt;code&gt;cmbu.local&lt;/code&gt; that CoreDNS will be responsible for. Then I will use the &lt;code&gt;k8s_gateway&lt;/code&gt; plugin to automatically create records for Services provisioned within my zone.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Running CoreDNS for lab name resolution</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/running-coredns-for-lab-name-resolution/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/running-coredns-for-lab-name-resolution/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Up until recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been running a Windows Server Core VM with Active Directory, DNS and Certificate Services deployed to provide some core features in my home lab. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been conscious that running a lab on old hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly have much in the way of green credentials. So, in an effort to reduce my carbon footprint (and electricity bill) I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for ways to shut down my lab when it&amp;rsquo;s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
