It’s pretty simple to install in a domain environment – you run the installer to create a collection server, then activate the forwarder on the client servers.
When it comes to servers you really want to audit, those that are by definition more at risk from security breach because they are publicly accessible, it’s not so straightforward.</description></item></channel></rss>
