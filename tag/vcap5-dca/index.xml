 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; studying and the exam experience of the VCAP5-DCA exam
&lt;/a&gt; (and 3 weeks of waking up to check my phone for the email all night) I am pleased to say that I received my Exam Score last week and it was a pass! I was really pleased to see that I passed with a  very decent margin too, which was great! The rushed nature of the exam and long wait for the results leaves you going over the exam in your head convincing yourself how badly you’ve done, so it came as a huge relief and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
