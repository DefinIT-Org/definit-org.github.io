&lt;p&gt;It is with great relief that I can announce I have passed my VCP NV (Network Virtualisation) having been caught out by the difficulty of the exam and failing previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="exam-preparation"&gt;Exam Preparation &lt;a class="anchor" href="#exam-preparation"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to attend a VMware internal bootcamp (roughly equivalent to the ICM course) for NSX and have had experience deploying production NSX environments, so that is by far the best preparation. As always, the &lt;a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/lcms/web/portals/certification/VCP_Blueprints/VCP-NV-Exam-Blueprint-v1_2.pdf"&gt;exam blueprint&lt;/a&gt; is crucial, you *have* to know all areas covered there. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been reading the &lt;a href="http://pubs.vmware.com/NSX-6/index.jsp#com.vmware.nsx.install.doc/GUID-D8578F6E-A40C-493A-9B43-877C2B75ED52.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; and design and deploy guides published by VMware, and completed the basic and advanced &lt;a href="http://www.projectnee.com/HOL/catalogs/"&gt;hands on labs&lt;/a&gt; that are also freely available. On top of that there is the &lt;a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/quiz.cfm?item=57466"&gt;official practice exam&lt;/a&gt; which I strongly suggest you do as it reflects the real exam well, and there are a series of fantastic &lt;a href="http://www.elasticsky.co.uk/practice-questions/"&gt;practice tests by Paul McSharry&lt;/a&gt; available while provide a decent test of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
