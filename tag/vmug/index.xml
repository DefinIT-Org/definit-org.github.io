That article helped me relax into who I am from a professional point of view, but it also challenged me.
I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career.</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG &amp;ndash; Curry &amp;ndash; Beer &amp;ndash; Sessions &amp;ndash; Weddings</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</guid><description>This was my second UKVMUG and it was my first vCurry evening! so I was really looking forward to getting up to the event and seeing everyone.
The vCurry event was excellent and it was a great chance to enjoy good food in great company. Had the chance to meet with many people I would not normally get the chance to see, Frank @fbuechsel and Brad @VMUG_CEO to name a couple!</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG Ravello Home Lab Winner!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-ravello-home-lab-winner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:11:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-ravello-home-lab-winner/</guid><description>First of all, thank you to everyone who came along to my session at the UKVMUG yesterday, it was great to see so many people at a round table discussion, sorry for those that had to stand! I hope that it was helpful and maybe a few of you will be building some awesome labs in the cloud!
Ravello very kindly sponsored a free home lab, equivalent to the vExpert 1000 hours account as a prize for my session at the UKVMUG yesterday.</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015 – Days 3 and 4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-2015-days-3-and-4/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2015 21:09:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-2015-days-3-and-4/</guid><description>Wednesday I had lined up several sessions so I was quick to get along to my first session - Operational Remediation with vRealize Operations… Tying it All Together - #MGT5735. The session was excellent and gave a great overview and introduction to what is possible with remediation in vROps 6.1. Big thanks to Chima Njaka for this session.
Aside from a few other sessions I spent a lot of the afternoon in the VMUG lounge with my colleagues from @xtravirt (see pic below) and meeting lots of other folk from the around the globe (this is what makes this conference so very great for me), putting faces to twitter handles for the first time and so on.</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015 – Day 2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-day-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 06:00:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld-day-2/</guid><description>The first full day of VMworld after PEX was a busy one.After the keynote (highlights were the docker announcements) I was on “booth babe” duty at the VMUG lounge. It was great to meet so many folk who were existing VMUG members and leaders as well as prospective new members. If you are at VMworld this year you should definitely stop by!
After lunch I hit the solutions exchange to catch up with a few vendors whom I had a few queries for also took the time to collect the #vExpert hoodie from @simplivity and the #vExpert tile from Tegile (thank you!</description></item><item><title>In response to @h0bbel: The "vCommunity"</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/in-response-to-h0bbel-the-vcommunity/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2015 07:43:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/04/in-response-to-h0bbel-the-vcommunity/</guid><description>This is not my normal sort of post - don&amp;rsquo;t worry, normal service will resume shortly.
I read Christian&amp;rsquo;s comments on the vCommunity - or lack of it - yesterday and although some things resonate with me, and a lot of other people, I don&amp;rsquo;t quite agree. I want to be clear this is a response to Christian and not an argument, I respect Christian as someone who does contribute to the vCommunity.</description></item><item><title>Why should you go to a VMUG?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/why-should-you-go-to-a-vmug/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2015 15:37:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/why-should-you-go-to-a-vmug/</guid><description>Having been a VMUG member for several years and now a VMUG leader I have seen the value of being a VMUG member and attending the meetings/events/conferences continue to increase.
So why do I think you should you go? If you are using VMware technologies/products in your workplace or you are regularly consulting on said VMware products, the VMUG events are in my opinion invaluable.
It simply doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what experience/knowledge you have of the products, whether you are very new to virtualization or an old hand I guarantee you will come away from any VMUG meeting having learned something useful or dare I say been a great source/help to others whom you have met and networked with.</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG 2014</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/11/ukvmug-2014/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2014 12:27:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/11/ukvmug-2014/</guid><description>Yesterday (in case you missed it) was the fourth annual UK national VMUG at the National Motorcycle Museum in Birmingham. It was my second year attending and I continue to be blown away with the quality and value available at this event.
There&amp;rsquo;s a huge amount of content packed into this one-day event, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try and summarise my day…
vCurry and vQuiz The vCurry event was hosted on Monday night and is a great way to chill out after a long drive up to the midlands.</description></item><item><title>My first VMworld..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/my-first-vmworld/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 12:38:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/my-first-vmworld/</guid><description>As this was my first VMworld I am not ashamed to say I was really stoked about attending, many of my peers have attended in the past and were going to attend.
I flew in on the Sunday evening so that I could register early on Monday for partner day, however I did miss the chance to attend what turned out to be a very popular and very full Rockstar event on the Sunday evening.</description></item><item><title>Another fantastic South West UK VMUG</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/another-fantastic-south-west-uk-vmug/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 09:09:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/another-fantastic-south-west-uk-vmug/</guid><description>On the 3rd of June we had our second South West UK VMUG and I am pleased to say it went superbly well.

The committee seem to do a fantastic job every time and this one was no exception, so thanks to Alaric Davies, Jane Rimmer, Stuart Thompson and Simon Gallagher!
One of the best things for me about the VMUG is the chance to chat with some of the smartest and most influential people in the VMware world – a trip to the coffee table provided a great opportunity to “chew the vfat” with two of the VMUG&amp;rsquo;s biggest characters, Mike Laverick and Ricky El-Qasem – all before any sessions had started.</description></item><item><title>Online VMware Forum – my thoughts</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/online-vmware-forum-my-thoughts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2014 21:35:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/online-vmware-forum-my-thoughts/</guid><description>This was the second online event I have attended in the last few months, the first being the VMUG Virtual event back in January. One of the aspects I enjoyed the most about that event was being able to chat to many well known and familiar faces from the wider community.
In this recent event there was a lot of focus on the various offerings from VMware with a good deal of focus on VSAN, NSX, Horizon and vCHS but certainly not neglecting their other offerings.</description></item><item><title>South West UK VMUG ready to launch! – 18th February</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/south-west-uk-vmug-ready-to-launch-18th-february/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 15:02:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/01/south-west-uk-vmug-ready-to-launch-18th-february/</guid><description>So what is VMUG? The VMware User Group (VMUG) is an independent, global, customer-led organization, created to maximize members’ use of VMware and partner solutions through knowledge sharing, training, collaboration, and events.
Presently there are five VMUGs in the UK including the latest addition - South West UK VMUG - @swukvmug
Why am I involved and why should you come along? I had been using VMware products for over 3 years and after joining twitter it was very clear to me the VMware user community was very friendly and also very helpful, it was there I learned about VMUG so the chance to meet and greet other users like myself and of course learn from the &amp;ldquo;rockstars&amp;rdquo; was to good an opportunity to pass up, after attending several meetings I was completely sold.</description></item><item><title>New VMUG Launched – South West VMUG UK</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/new-vmug-launched-south-west-vmug-uk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2013 09:00:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/new-vmug-launched-south-west-vmug-uk/</guid><description>South West VMware User Group: The Facts, The Figures, And The Events The South West VMware User Group launches in the UK, bringing the best of VMware and the user community to The West, South West and South Wales.

Generally it was a great day, with loads of really good sessions and some really cool community and vendor content.
As ever it was great day for socialising and networking with people who you interact with on twitter. For me one of the major benefits of the VMUG is learning from other people’s experience. Twitter was alive with the hastag #LonVMUG and it definitely adds something to the day to be active</description></item></channel></rss>
