When you&amp;rsquo;ve deployed the PSC as the single sign on layer of a distributed vRealize Automation deployment, you don&amp;rsquo;t have the vSphere Web Client to configure it in the same way.</description></item><item><title>Automate changing the vSphere 6 Platform Services Controller IP address (and vRealize Automation)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/automate-changing-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-ip-address/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2015 15:04:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/automate-changing-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-ip-address/</guid><description>Note: This falls under the “I don’t think this is supported” category – use this method at your own peril!
As part of some testing I’ve been doing for vRealize Automation DR scenarios, I wanted to test changing the IP address of a HA PSC pair using a script (think SRM failover to a new subnet).
What I didn’t want to do was simply edit the connections directly – quite often with the VMware appliances there are scripts on start-up to ensure the configuration is correct and consistent – what I wanted was to be able to find a more supported and reliable way.</description></item><item><title>Resetting the vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller root password</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 13:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how supported this is, but this process can recover a vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller when you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the root password.
Download the OpenSUSE Rescue CD - http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/13.2/iso/
Mount the CD to the PSC Appliance
Reboot the appliance and enter the BIOS setup using F2, configure the CD-ROM as first-boot device. Save and exit to reboot into the SUSE Live-CD.
Once the Live-CD has booted to a desktop, you’ll see a 12GB volume at the top – that’s your PSC appliance root.</description></item><item><title>vSphere 6 HA SSO (PSC) with NetScaler VPX Load Balancer for vRealize Automation</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/vsphere-6-ha-sso-psc-with-netscaler-vpx-load-balancer-for-vrealize-automation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jul 2015 15:40:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/vsphere-6-ha-sso-psc-with-netscaler-vpx-load-balancer-for-vrealize-automation/</guid><description>vSphere 6 HA SSO (PSC) with NetScaler VPX Load Balancer for vRealize Automation Deploying vRealize Automation 6.2 Appliance Cluster with Postgres Replication Deploying fully distributed vRealize Automation IaaS components - Part 1: Pre-requisites Deploying fully distributed vRealize Automation IaaS components - Part 2: Database, Web and Manager services Deploying fully distributed vRealize Automation instance - Configuring NetScaler Monitors Providing a highly available single sign on for vRealize Automation is a fundamental part of ensuring the availability of the platform.</description></item><item><title>Unable to connect NSX to Lookup Service when using a vSphere 6 subordinate certificate authority (VMCA)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/06/unable-to-connect-nsx-to-lookup-service-when-using-a-vsphere-6-subordinate-certificate-authority-vmca/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2015 12:26:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/06/unable-to-connect-nsx-to-lookup-service-when-using-a-vsphere-6-subordinate-certificate-authority-vmca/</guid><description>After deploying a new vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) and configuring the Platform Services Controller (PSC) to act as a subordinate Certificate Authority (CS), I was unable to register the NSX Manager to the Lookup Service. Try saying that fast after a pint or two!?
Attempting to register NSX to the Lookup Service would result in the following error:
NSX Management Service operation failed.( Initialization of Admin Registration Service Provider failed.</description></item></channel></rss>
