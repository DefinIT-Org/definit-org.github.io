It&amp;rsquo;s more than a little motivated by some friendly competition with a Microsoft PFE for SCOM, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll agree it&amp;rsquo;s a big improvement on the last version.
Updated for this version
Formatting changed to make it more readable and more compatible Added &amp;ldquo;Report generated on &amp;rdquo; to the top of the report Management Server states reported as one section Default MP check moved to beneathÂ the Management servers Agents in pending states moved to be with the Agent health states Clarified &amp;ldquo;Unresponsive Agents&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Agents reporting errors&amp;rdquo; Management server alerts streamlined Added top 10 alerts for the last 7 days, and added top alerters for each I&amp;rsquo;m planning to wrap in some SQL database size checks and some of the other recommendations later - I&amp;rsquo;ll post again here when that&amp;rsquo;s ready ðŸ™‚</description></item></channel></rss>
