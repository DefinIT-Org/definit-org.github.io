&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I’m backing my vCloud Director installation with NSX-T, I will be using my existing Tier-0 router, which interfaces with my physical router via BGP. The Tier-0 router will be connected to the Tier-1 router, the NSX-T logical switches will be connected to the Tier-1, and the IP networks advertised to the Tier-0 (using NSX-T’s internal routing mechanism) and up via eBGP to the physical router.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lab Notes – vCloud Director 9.1 for Service Providers – Part 5: vRealize Orchestrator Cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/07/lab-notes-vcloud-director-9-1-for-service-providers-part-5-vrealize-orchestrator-cluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jul 2018 16:07:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/07/lab-notes-vcloud-director-9-1-for-service-providers-part-5-vrealize-orchestrator-cluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;This series was originally going to be a more polished endeavour, but unfortunately time got in the way.

&lt;p&gt;This means that Virtual Machines deployed as EC2 instances in an AWS VPC require the ability to talk back to internal corporate networks - not something you&amp;rsquo;d want to publish on the internet! That&amp;rsquo;s where AWS&amp;rsquo;s VPN connections come in - you can create several types of VPN that allow such communication over a secure (encrypted) virtual private network.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>There is no one cloud solution to rule them all..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/there-is-no-one-cloud-solution-to-rule-them-all/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 17:01:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/there-is-no-one-cloud-solution-to-rule-them-all/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/theonering.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have been musing this a little while and decided to write this post/rant/opinion post, feel free to post your thoughts and opinions in the comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK so here it is, one thing I have observed for a good while now is how much noise there is about how -you- should be in the cloud (Public) and if you are not you&amp;rsquo;re already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call Bull****!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public, Hybrid and Private clouds are &lt;strong&gt;solutions&lt;/strong&gt; not final destinations, regardless of whether you are a customer, partner, or any other third thing you should be purely focused on what is best for you or (if you provide IT services) your customer. It is plainly obvious to me that in -all- of the customers I have visited there has been no appetite or reason to mass adopt any single one solution/option as it simply would not fit how they do business and function day to day. There will of course be exceptions to this rule but they are indeed exceptions not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Adding an AWS endpoint to vRealize Automation 7</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/adding-an-amazon-web-services-endpoint-to-vrealize-automation-7/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jul 2016 09:46:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/adding-an-amazon-web-services-endpoint-to-vrealize-automation-7/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Although it&amp;rsquo;s fairly limited, you can add AWS as an endpoint for vRealize Automation 7  and consume EC2 AMIs as part of a blueprint. You can even add the deployed instances to an existing Elastic Load Balancer at deploy time. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll run through the basics to get up and running and deploy your first highly available (multiple Availability Zone, load balanced) blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious pre-requisites for attaching an AWS endpoint - for example, you need to have a VPC configured. There are plenty of resources out there for creating a VPC, so I won&amp;rsquo;t extend this post by replicating them. This is what I&amp;rsquo;m using:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VCDX-CMA 204</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vcdx-cma-204/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2015 11:51:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vcdx-cma-204/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apologies in advance if this is post is a jumbled nonsense, I&amp;rsquo;m still way too excited!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke to the news that I have passed my VCDX-CMA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second attempt at VCDX and although the first failure was a painful experience, the lessons learned from it were invaluable to take into the defence the second time around. Failing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a negative experience - if there is one thing that I will take from the VCDX program it is that there is ALWAYS more I need to learn, and I can always do better. Learning has to be a way of life (in this industry especially!) and the minute you stop, you start falling back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
