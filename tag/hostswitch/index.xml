With vRLCM I can reduce the administrative overhead of managing the environments, as well as easily migrate content between environments (I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging on some of these cool new features soon).
However, I hit a snag when I began to import my existing environment - I couldnâ€™t get the vCenter data collection to run.</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Transport Zones and Transport Nodes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/10/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-transport-zones-and-transport-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2017 21:17:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/10/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-transport-zones-and-transport-nodes/</guid><description>Disclaimer! I am learning NSX-T, part of my learning is to deploy in my lab - if I contradict the official docs then go with the docs!
Lab Environment This NSX-T lab environment is built as a nested lab on my physical hosts. There are four physical ESXi hosts, onto which I will deploy three ESXi VMs, a vCenter Server Appliance, NSX Manager, an NSX Controller cluster, and two NSX Edge Nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
