Iwan Rahabok, did a great job on this one, talking about the the concept of SDDC operations and I would recommend this session to anyone who wants a jump-start into transforming their operations for SDDC. Quickly want to thank Iwan here for spending his valuable time with us and giving back to the community through this Webinar Series, Blogs, Books etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
