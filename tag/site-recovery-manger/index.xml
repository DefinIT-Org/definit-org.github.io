I am creating two sites on the same IP subnet (pretend it&amp;rsquo;s a stretched LAN across two sites) and will be protecting a single, tiny Linux web server using vSphere Replication. I&amp;rsquo;m aiming to cover SAN based replication in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
