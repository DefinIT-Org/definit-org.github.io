&lt;p&gt;The main session was great particularly HCX announcement and the VR admin demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then hit the solutions exchange as soon as it opened. There are all the usual suspects there -except- Cisco (anyone know why?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also great to see the guys from &lt;a href="https://bluemedora.com/"&gt;Blue Medora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
