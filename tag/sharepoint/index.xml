One of the limitations that caused headaches was that it used to have a maximum storage of 4GB, which was the database limit. If you wanted to go larger, you would need either a) multiple SPS installations, b) a full version of SQL server, or c) the full version of MOSS.</description></item><item><title>MOSS 2007 â€“ Alternate Access Mapping authentication fails</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/moss-2007-%E2%80%93-alternate-access-mapping-authentication-fails/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2009 14:58:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/10/moss-2007-%E2%80%93-alternate-access-mapping-authentication-fails/</guid><description>If you have an Alternate Access Mapping configured for a MOSS 2007 site with Integrated Authentication you might find that you get prompted for the DOMAIN\UserName and Password.

In site editing mode, all the drop down menus would appear for a flash and then go blank. The actual admin pages we were trying to get to would work if you entered them into the browser directly, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy way to manage the site!
The problem turned out to be that in the process of getting the 3rd party web parts to work, the support team had added a MIME type to the IIS installation.</description></item></channel></rss>
