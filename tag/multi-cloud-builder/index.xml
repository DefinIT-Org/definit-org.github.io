Multi-Cloud Builder The course took place over 4 days and was very well structured.
Initialy, we were given the VMware vision on Multi-Cloud and then we were straight into the &amp;ldquo;good stuff&amp;rdquo; hands-on-labs. This would be a consistent and well executed theme for the 4 days.
VMware now have an impressive global cloud presence utilising their partnerships with major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and several others.</description></item></channel></rss>
