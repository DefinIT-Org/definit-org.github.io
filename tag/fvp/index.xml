It makes you truly appreciate the awesome power of FVP, even on my less than spectacular hardware in my lab, when it&amp;rsquo;s taken away for a while.
Now that FVP 3.0 has GA&amp;rsquo;d, I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to getting my lab storage accelerated - it makes a huge difference.</description></item><item><title>Unable to start PernixData FVP Management Server – service-specific error code 0</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/unable-to-start-pernixdata-fvp-management-server-service-specific-error-code-0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 10:14:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/unable-to-start-pernixdata-fvp-management-server-service-specific-error-code-0/</guid><description>Having finally got some SSDs to be able to use my PernixPro/PernixPrime NFR license, I thought it was about time to get PernixData&amp;rsquo;s FVP 2.0 running in my lab again. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used FVP in my lab since it was running in beta, so I was keen to see the awesome new features in action. It really is an easy install process and took me less than an hour to get my cluster up and running with VMs I/O being accelerated.</description></item><item><title>Blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani – PernixData</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2014 15:31:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/blogger-briefing-with-satyam-vaghani-pernixdata/</guid><description>Recently I had the good fortune to be invited along to a blogger briefing with Satyam Vaghani CTO and Co-founder of PernixData.Those of you not in the know Satyam already has quite the track record, more notably for authoring 50+ patents, Principle engineer and Storage CTO for VMware (10 years). So it is safe to say he knows a thing or two about storage and related technology!
Nine of us (bloggers) were in attendance.</description></item><item><title>Pernixdata – ICM and initial impressions – part 1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/pernixdata-icm-and-initial-impressions-part-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 17:37:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/pernixdata-icm-and-initial-impressions-part-1/</guid><description>Since the keynote by Frank Denneman at the LonVMUG many months ago the PernixData product has been something I wanted to test to see what benefits it may or may not bring to our SQL environment, I did have the good fortune to briefly beta test it last year but this blog post will cover the current full version (FVP 1.0.2.0). I am aware that 1.5 is just around the corner and with it comes full support for vSphere 5.</description></item></channel></rss>
