UMDS is tool you can install to download patches (and third party VIBs - I&amp;rsquo;ll get to that) for Update Manager and it&amp;rsquo;s useful for environments that don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the internet, or air-gapped, and also for environments with multiple vCenter Servers where you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to download the same patch on every server.</description></item></channel></rss>
