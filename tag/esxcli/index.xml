Now 6 has been GA a while and I have a little bit of time, I have begun the lab upgrade process. You can see a bit more about my lab hardware over on my lab page.</description></item><item><title>PowerCLI Script to set RDM LUNs to Perennially Reserved – Fixes Slow Boot of ESXi 5.1 with MSCS RDMs</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/03/powercli-script-to-set-rdm-luns-to-perennially-reserved-fixes-slow-boot-of-esxi-5-1-with-mscs-rdms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2013 14:02:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/03/powercli-script-to-set-rdm-luns-to-perennially-reserved-fixes-slow-boot-of-esxi-5-1-with-mscs-rdms/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve previously posted around this topic as part of another problem but having had to figure out the process again I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth re-posting a proper script for this. VMware KB 1016106 is snappily titled &amp;ldquo;ESXi/ESX hosts with visibility to RDM LUNs being used by MSCS nodes with RDMs may take a long time to boot or during LUN rescan&amp;rdquo; and describes the situation where booting ESXi (5.1 in my case) takes a huge amount of time to boot because it&amp;rsquo;s attempting to gain a SCSI reservation on an RDM disk used by MS Clustering Services.</description></item></channel></rss>
