&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I attended a workshop with Jad El Zein in Barcelona last year and it was one of the best sessions I attended, especially as it was just on the news of vRA7&amp;rsquo;s release. This workshop was this year&amp;rsquo;s equivelant, but because the session included a lot of people just getting started with vRA a lot of the time was taken to explain what vRA does, so there was no real time for the more in depth details on the new features that are coming (some already announced and in Tech Preview). I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t begrudge the guys just starting the chance to hear the basics from Jad, but I think a more expert session would also be good.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld 2016 – My session picks</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vmworld-2016-my-session-picks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2016 11:13:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vmworld-2016-my-session-picks/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;In my post yesterday I promised to post my VMworld session picks, so here it is! I have filled my schedule, and even added some alternate picks when there were too many good sessions to go for. My session picks are focussing around:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vRealize Automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NSX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;VSAN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerCLI, APIs and automation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before anyone tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve picked too many and I won&amp;rsquo;t make it to all of them - I know! I can guarantee I&amp;rsquo;ll get distracted/tired/hungry and won&amp;rsquo;t make all of them, but if I could…&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
