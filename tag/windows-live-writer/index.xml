One of the cool things with BE.Net is that it does work with WLW, not only that but it works well. Setup was a breeze and within 2 minutes I&amp;rsquo;m now writing my first post, including tags and categories (hit F2 if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do that in WLW).
Now this is cool!</description></item></channel></rss>
