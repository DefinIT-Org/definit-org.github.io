&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to configure vCloud Air as a vCloud Director host in vRealize Orchestrator in order to create some custom resource actions for Day 2 operations in vRealize Automation. What I found was that there&amp;rsquo;s *very* little information out there on how to do this, and I ended up writing my own custom resource mapping for the virtual machines to VCAC:VirtualMachine objects - at least that way I could add my resource action. But this still didn&amp;rsquo;t expose the vCloud Director functionality for those machines. To do this I needed vCloud Air added as a vCloud Director host.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware #vForum London and bloggers VSAN/vCHS lunch</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vmware-vforum-london-and-bloggers-vsanvchs-lunch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 15:35:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vmware-vforum-london-and-bloggers-vsanvchs-lunch/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/06/VMware_Forum_2014_Banner_v3.png" alt=""&gt;Fairly recently i attended the annual VMware vForum London 2014 at Wembley stadium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never been to a vForum i would certainly recommend it as it offers the chance to not only attend excellent and pertinent sessions but there is also the opportunity to network and visit the large vendor hall which as ever was a busy place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="keynote-and-sessions"&gt;Keynote and sessions &lt;a class="anchor" href="#keynote-and-sessions"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opening keynote by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBaguley" title="Joe Baguley"&gt;@joebaguley&lt;/a&gt; (Joe Baguley) was excellent and as challenging as ever one aspect that stood out to me personally was the question &amp;ldquo;where are you on your journey?&amp;rdquo; (see pic/slide below)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Another fantastic South West UK VMUG</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/another-fantastic-south-west-uk-vmug/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 09:09:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/another-fantastic-south-west-uk-vmug/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/06/vmug_logo.png" alt=""&gt;On the 3rd of June we had our second &lt;a href="http://www.vmug.com/index.php?mo=cm&amp;amp;op=ld&amp;amp;fid=217&amp;amp;gid=255" title="South West UK VMUG"&gt;South West UK VMUG&lt;/a&gt; and I am pleased to say it went superbly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As before we held it at the &lt;a href="http://mshed.org/"&gt;Mshed&lt;/a&gt; facilities in Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a great day with many sessions from sponsors,vendors and community speakers alike!&lt;/p&gt;

The first data center residing in Slough with more data centers planned across Europe in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an SME that has several existing vSphere environments this was of real interest, as the need to scale out quickly from our Private clouds is rapidly becoming a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already spoken to VMware on the phone to get a rough idea on options and costs I decided to take a look at the &lt;a href="http://labs.hol.vmware.com/" title="Hands on Labs"&gt;Hands-on-labs&lt;/a&gt; to see how easy it really is to use and migrate VMs from an existing private cloud to vCHS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
