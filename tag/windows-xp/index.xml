Cisco Discovery Protocol is a great tool for network admins when you need to quickly map routers and switches, and if you’ve got an ESX server connected you’ll see that it picks up CDP info too – but the vast majority of my managed systems are Windows.
Here’s how to use TCPDUMP by Micro Olap to extend that functionality to your Windows boxes.</description></item><item><title>How to force the removal of Folder Redirection from specific user accounts</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/04/how-to-force-the-removal-of-folder-redirection-from-specific-user-accounts/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2009 11:14:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/04/how-to-force-the-removal-of-folder-redirection-from-specific-user-accounts/</guid><description>We have a folder redirection policy in place for all of our users in combination with a roaming profile policy - this policy is applied to the OU that contains our users. Unfortunately this policy was accidently linked to the root of our domain too, causing our Domain Admin users to be redirected too - something we do not want. When the mistake was discovered, the policy was unlinked, but the redirection remained (despite being set to revert when users fall out of scope).</description></item><item><title>Dell Latitude E6500 blue screen of death on XP install/downgrade/reinstall</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/01/dell-latitude-e6500-blue-screen-of-death-on-xp-installdowngradereinstall/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2009 12:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/01/dell-latitude-e6500-blue-screen-of-death-on-xp-installdowngradereinstall/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just had a frustrating few days trying to downgrade 4 Dell Latitude E6500 laptops to XP. The problem was, whenever you booted to the XP cd you would get to the point just before you agree to the license and then hit a blue screen with a SATA error code. It seems that the bundled driver for the SATA storage controller incorrectly identifies it and causes a fatal error as it&amp;rsquo;s loaded.</description></item><item><title>Create a 100Mb file for testing transfer speeds</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/create-a-100mb-file-for-testing-transfer-speeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2008 10:58:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/07/create-a-100mb-file-for-testing-transfer-speeds/</guid><description>We have a Bonded ADSL solution for our servers to provide the necessary upstream transfer speeds for the applications we host. We have bonded ADSL because our exchange still doesn&amp;rsquo;t support SDSL, and a leased line is overkill. Theoretically, we should have 28.1 Mbps download and 3.2Mbps upload - what I am actually seeing is about 1.7Mbps down and 1.9Mbps up. I have tested this on various servers, over various times and file sizes, there is no doubt that the performance is POOR.</description></item><item><title>Fixing your Windows Vista MBR</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/05/fixing-your-windows-vista-mbr/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 19:36:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/05/fixing-your-windows-vista-mbr/</guid><description>I recently installed Vista as a dual boot with my old XP installation, while I transferred things over and made sure I could do all I need to do with my new Vista install. It came to the point when I needed to remove XP and solely rely on Vista. Some might say that&amp;rsquo;s brave, others foolish, others still insane. Whatever your opinion, I needed the HD space and was having no problems with Vista, so I bit the bullet.</description></item></channel></rss>
