&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the bigger items to arrive very shortly is vRealize Operations Cloud (SaaS), this means you do not need to worry about standing vROps up in your environment to see what value it can bring to your infrastructure monitoring. It has the same feature set and UI as the on-premises offering.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
