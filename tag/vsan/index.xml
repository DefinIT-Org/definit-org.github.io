&lt;/a&gt;
to enable Persistent Volumes backed by vSphere storage. This allows me to use
Storage Policy to create Persistent Volumes based on policy. For example, I’m
going to create two classes of storage, &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slow&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Fast&lt;/em&gt; will be vSAN
based and &lt;em&gt;Slow&lt;/em&gt; will be NFS based.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One Node vSAN Lab Host</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/one-node-vsan-lab-host/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Dec 2017 12:43:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/one-node-vsan-lab-host/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A little while ago I replaced my three ageing Intel NUC hosts with a single (still ageing) Dell T7500 workstation. The workstation provides 24 processor cores and 96GB RAM for a really reasonable price, while still being quiet enough to sit in my home office. One of the driving factors in retiring the old NUCs was vSAN - I know in the newer generations of NUC you can get an M2 and a SATA SSD in, but my 1st gen. models could only do a single M2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Simon’s #VMworld 2017: Sunday and Monday</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/simons-vmworld-day-1-and-2-sunday-and-monday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 13:29:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/simons-vmworld-day-1-and-2-sunday-and-monday/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="sunday"&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/09/VMworld-2017.jpg" alt=""&gt;Sunday &lt;a class="anchor" href="#sunday"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving in early on Sunday as the local flight choices are more limited from Bristol than perhaps a larger Airport, very fortunate to have a hotel so close to the VMworld venue, perhaps not so great for the evening activities but I am happy with it this way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than registration (4pm-8pm) and hopefully catching up with a few folk who have also arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening I had the pleasure to meet many awesome people from the vCommunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sam’s #VMworld 2017: vSAN Specialist and VMware {Code} Hackathon</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-vsan-specialist-and-vmware-code-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:41:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-vsan-specialist-and-vmware-code-hackathon/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always like to take a discounted exam at VMworld, this year I opted for the VMware vSAN 2017 Specialist exam, which was released a few weeks ago. Having delivered quite a few vSAN based solutions over the last few years, I was fairly confident in the blueprint. I am pleased to say that I passed the exam with a score of 422, way higher than I expected! I thought the exam itself was fair, and covered and tested the basics of vSAN well. You definitely need to know the supported architectures and how storage policies effect and apply to the data on vSAN.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vSAN Cache Performance Dashboard in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/vsan-cache-performance-dashboard-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 14:09:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/vsan-cache-performance-dashboard-in-vrops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/02/vsan.jpg" alt=""&gt;I have recently been able to get vSAN properly up and running in my lab and took a look at the OOTB Dashboards that come with the MPSD (&lt;a href="https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/products/vrealize-operations-management-pack-for-storage-devices" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I have a hybrid build (I know many have All Flash Arrays) I was interested in how hard my Flash Cache was working so I built a dashboard purely focused on this aspect of the vSAN product.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator Workflow: shutdownVSANCluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;My vSphere lab is split into two halves - a low power management cluster, powered by 3 Intel NUCs, and a more hefty workload cluster powered by a Dell C6100 chassis with 3 nodes.

&lt;li&gt;vSphere Update Manager - currently 5.5 update 1&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1 Intel NUC management host&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*This post was meant to be published on Friday, VMworld Sleep Deprivation meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t click the button!*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the last post and a bit of a wrap up on my VMworld 2014 series!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a keynote on day three, and there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a &amp;ldquo;winding down&amp;rdquo; feel as people tend to arrive later (if at all) and many are…feeling the effects of the previous night shall we say! That said, every session I wanted to attend was still fully booked and it was a case of queuing for the spare seats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware #vForum London and bloggers VSAN/vCHS lunch</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vmware-vforum-london-and-bloggers-vsanvchs-lunch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 15:35:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/06/vmware-vforum-london-and-bloggers-vsanvchs-lunch/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/06/VMware_Forum_2014_Banner_v3.png" alt=""&gt;Fairly recently i attended the annual VMware vForum London 2014 at Wembley stadium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never been to a vForum i would certainly recommend it as it offers the chance to not only attend excellent and pertinent sessions but there is also the opportunity to network and visit the large vendor hall which as ever was a busy place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; (Joe Baguley) was excellent and as challenging as ever one aspect that stood out to me personally was the question &amp;ldquo;where are you on your journey?&amp;rdquo; (see pic/slide below)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What about VSAN for SMB/SME?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/what-about-vsan-for-smbsme/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2014 15:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/what-about-vsan-for-smbsme/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware2.jpg" alt=""&gt;Unless you have been sleeping under a rock you will be aware that VSAN was launched last week and has gone &lt;a href="http://cto.vmware.com/the-dawn-of-vsan/" title="The Dawn of Virtual SAN" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; GA today
&lt;/a&gt; and from what I have seen so far I do think VSAN is a great product and I think VMware have done a superb job with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-many-&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; discussions on twitter and other channels regarding the then lack of licensing information and pricing I was eager to see if VMware would offer a &amp;ldquo;foundation&amp;rdquo; VSAN option for SMB/SME&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
