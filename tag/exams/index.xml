The VCP-DCV 2021 certification validates candidate skills to implement, manage, and troubleshoot a vSphere infrastructure, using best practices to provide a powerful, flexible, and secure foundation for business agility that can accelerate the transformation to cloud computing.
The Exam The exam covers a broad spectrum of vSphere components as you would expect.</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Foundation Specialist Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/vmware-cloud-foundation-specialist-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/vmware-cloud-foundation-specialist-exam-experience/</guid><description>Being a Consultant within a VMware Principal Partner there are standards we need to meet and preferably exceed.
Master Services Competencies (MSCs) are VMware partner designations designed to recognize services-capable partners with delivery expertise and experience within a VMware solution area.
With that in mind I sat the VCF Specialist exam.
The Exam The exam covers a broad spectrum of VMware technologies (vSphere, NSX-T, vSAN, Tanzu) I was apprehensive about it as there is an awful lot of material to cover that the exam expects you to have good knowledge of.</description></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka-exam-experience/</guid><description>Since I started learning Kubernetes the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam has been a target for me, but it&amp;rsquo;s always seemed to be out of reach. The whole Kubernetes ecosystem is a vast and nebulous beast, with new projects rising to the fore all the time, and old projects fading from favour. The size and rapid development that make the field so interesting and powerful, are the same properties that make the learning curve so steep, and the entry bar so high.</description></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-cks-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/02/certified-kubernetes-security-specialist-cks-exam-experience/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist exam booked for a long time - so long in fact that the exam voucher was due to expire at the end of January 2022! I figured I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go right at the start of January, work out how far off the mark I was and then aim to do the free retake before it expired at the end of the month.</description></item><item><title>Samâ€™s #VMworld 2017: vSAN Specialist and VMware {Code} Hackathon</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-vsan-specialist-and-vmware-code-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:41:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-vsan-specialist-and-vmware-code-hackathon/</guid><description>VMware vSAN 2017 Specialist Exam I always like to take a discounted exam at VMworld, this year I opted for the VMware vSAN 2017 Specialist exam, which was released a few weeks ago. Having delivered quite a few vSAN based solutions over the last few years, I was fairly confident in the blueprint. I am pleased to say that I passed the exam with a score of 422, way higher than I expected!</description></item></channel></rss>
