&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Home Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt; - as you can see this is a very useful and helpful way or presenting a high level set of data about your environment with also many ways to interact and interrogate the data you are being presented with. Among other items you can filter on (Health/Risk/Efficiency), alter the scope, see alerts relative to the objects you are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 8 : SDDC Operations with vROps Custom Dashboards</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-8-sddc-operations-with-vrops-custom-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Aug 2016 08:30:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-8-sddc-operations-with-vrops-custom-dashboards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;This time around Iwan Rahabok will lead the next session of the vROps Webinar Series while Sunny and myself will support him to deliver some awesome content which Iwan has developed over the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this time around we will move our focus from vROps as a Product and related features to the concept of running your SDDC operations with vRealize Operations Dashboards. Just to clarify, this is not a session where we will teach you to create dashboards, but this is a session where we would share how a set of Customised Dashboards can help any organisation&amp;rsquo;s IT to get an insight into Storage, Network &amp;amp; Compute within your SDDC. While vROps is primarily a Performance Management and Capacity Planning tool, we will take you to the other important aspects as well such as Availability and Configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
