&lt;p&gt;This post is nothing more than a shameless request for sponsorship! As the title suggests, I am running the London marathon this year (in 96 days!) for the charity &amp;ldquo;The Lighthouse Group&amp;rdquo;. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.tlg.org.uk/about.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; the TLG site
&lt;/a&gt; for more detail on what they do, but in a nutshell they are a charity that works with young people who have been excluded from school, at risk of exclusion or are at crisis point in their education. It&amp;rsquo;s a really worthwhile cause and my father-in-law has just been involved in opening a TLG center based in Normanton, Yorkshire&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
