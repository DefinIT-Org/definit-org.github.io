When can we have it installed by?”
The problem is, once they’ve purchased licensing for Exchange 2010 and installed and configured the server, migrated the users’ mailboxes and decommissioned the old Exchange 2003 server, the Online Archive feature is not available.</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 – CreateTestUser : Mailbox could not be created.

This is the script:
$ActiveSyncDevices = @() ForEach ($Mailbox in Get-Mailbox –Server MBX01) { Get-ActiveSyncDeviceStatistics -Mailbox $Mailbox.Identity –ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Select DeviceFriendlyName, Devicetype, DeviceUserAgent | ForEach-Object { $_ | Add-Member –MemberType NoteProperty -Name "MailboxIdentity" -value $Mailbox $ActiveSyncDevices += $_ } } $ActiveSyncDevices | Export-csv c:\Path\To\File.</description></item><item><title>Creating/Enabling Exchange 2010 Personal Archives</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/creatingenabling-exchange-2010-personal-archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 13:32:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/creatingenabling-exchange-2010-personal-archives/</guid><description>With the release of Exchange 2010 SP1, administrators can now use separate Mailbox Databases to store the Personal Archives of users – this is particularly useful if you have some larger, slower (and probably by virtue, older) storage that’s not really up to the I/O of your Exchange Server (that old SAN/NAS sitting in the corner of the server room?). It’s also useful if you just don’t have the capacity on your main storage.</description></item><item><title>Installing Exchange 2010 SP1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/installing-exchange-2010-sp1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 11:23:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/installing-exchange-2010-sp1/</guid><description>Exchange SP1 has now been released, so I thought I’d document the upgrade process for my small Exchange 2010 organisation, consisting of one CAS/Transport/Mailbox server, and an Edge Transport server.
References The starting point is always working out if you *need* to upgrade – what’s the business argument. For that you need to look at what’s new in Exchange 2010 SP1, the release notes and prerequisites. Finally, the installation instructions for upgrading from Exchange 2010 RTM to SP1.</description></item><item><title>Installing Exchange 2010 Edge Server with Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) – Part 1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/installing-exchange-2010-edge-server-with-forefront-protection-for-exchange-fpe-and-threat-management-gateway-tmg-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 13:59:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/installing-exchange-2010-edge-server-with-forefront-protection-for-exchange-fpe-and-threat-management-gateway-tmg-part-1/</guid><description>I am mid-migration, in a co-existence setup with Exchange 2010, 2007 and 2003. So far the roles installed for Exchange 2010 are CAS, Hub and Mailbox on a single server. Into this mix I need to introduce an Edge Server, with message hygiene in the form of Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) as a reverse proxy to publish OWA, ActiveSync et-al.
Since Edge, FPE and TMG can now all exist on a single 64-bit server, I will start with a clean installation of Windows Server 2008 R2, up to date with all the latest hot fixes.</description></item><item><title>Unable to access Outlook Web Access (OWA) after installing Update Rollup 1, 2, 3 or 4 – flogon.js errors</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/unable-to-access-outlook-web-access-owa-after-installing-update-rollup-1-2-3-or-4-flogon-js-errors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 11:02:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/unable-to-access-outlook-web-access-owa-after-installing-update-rollup-1-2-3-or-4-flogon-js-errors/</guid><description>If you’re having trouble accessing OWA after updating Exchange 2010 with any of the Rollup packages, try this:
Uninstall the update package from the Programs and Features control panel
Download the package file directly from Microsoft, don’t use Windows Update
Open a command prompt or PowerShell prompt as Administrator
Navigate to the location of the package (.msp) and run from the elevated command prompt.
Apparently when Windows update installs the package it doesn’t run it with the elevated privileges to write to the folder in the Exchange program files – why, I have no idea!</description></item><item><title>Testing access to your Exchange services with Microsoft Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/testing-access-to-your-exchange-services-with-microsoft-exchange-remote-connectivity-analyzer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 09:27:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/testing-access-to-your-exchange-services-with-microsoft-exchange-remote-connectivity-analyzer/</guid><description>The Microsoft Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer is perhaps the best tool I’ve used in a long time for troubleshooting Exchange external access – it just works!

The environment is a single AD domain with 4 sites, Site1, Site2, Site3 and Site4. In Site1, Site2 and Site3 there are 3 Exchange 2003 servers, one per site. In Site4 there is an Exchange 2007 SP2 server (CAS, Mailbox, HT). All the connectors required worked as expected, and inter-site routing works as expected.
I introduced into the mix a 2010 Enterprise server (CAS, Mailbox, HT) to Site1 as a prelude to a full upgrade of the site to Exchange 2010.</description></item><item><title>Exchange ActiveSync fails on iPhone after upgrade to iOS4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 15:55:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</guid><description>I’ve spent a fair bit of time today trying to sort out my iPhone sync to my Exchange Server, failing miserably. It used to work, pre-upgrade to iOS4, but for some reason fails to sync.
Symptoms were:

The iPhone was configured to accept the SSL certificate on the Exchange Server.</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 “New Local Move Request” and “New Remote Move Request” missing when you right-click a user’s MailBox</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/exchange-2010-%E2%80%9Cnew-local-move-request%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cnew-remote-move-request%E2%80%9D-missing-when-you-right-click-a-user%E2%80%99s-mailbox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 12:14:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/06/exchange-2010-%E2%80%9Cnew-local-move-request%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Cnew-remote-move-request%E2%80%9D-missing-when-you-right-click-a-user%E2%80%99s-mailbox/</guid><description>I’m currently testing an Exchange 2010 server for the organisation prior to a migration project, specifically testing moving mailboxes backwards and forwards. Something that confused me slightly for a few minutes was this: if there is an existing Move Request (pending, in progress, failed or completed) you will not see the “New Local Move Request” or “New Remote Move Request” -
Fortunately this is very simple to counter – simply clear the old “Move Request” and the options will be back in the Mailbox options:</description></item><item><title>Cisco Qualified!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/12/cisco-qualified/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2009 10:46:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/12/cisco-qualified/</guid><description>As is normally the case when I’m studying, I haven’t had time to post much on here lately.
