&lt;p&gt;Having recently managed several Exchange 2010 migration projects, one of the best new features which really sells it to systems administrators is the Online Archive. “No more managing PST files? When can we have it installed by?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, once they’ve purchased licensing for Exchange 2010 and installed and configured the server, migrated the users’ mailboxes and decommissioned the old Exchange 2003 server, the Online Archive feature is not available. The users have been enabled, and as of SP1 we have a separate Archive mailbox database configured on slow (cheap) storage, but the Online Archive is nowhere to be found in Outlook. If the users log on using OWA, lo and behold the Online Archive is available.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 – CreateTestUser : Mailbox could not be created.

&lt;p&gt;While using the New-TestCasConnectivityUser.ps1 script to create a test user for Exchange 2010’s connectivity testing, I ran into an issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/03/image_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, that OU does exist (as it will by default on any Windows Domain!) and the password complexity more than satisfied the complexity requirements. The issue is simple enough to fix, I opened the script in notepad and found the line beginning “new-mailbox” – and deleted the parameter “–OrgainisationalUnit:$OrganistationalUnit”. This means the new user defaults to the default OU – Users!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reporting all ActiveSync devices and their Users in Exchange 2010</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/reporting-all-activesync-devices-and-users-in-exchange-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 14:28:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/reporting-all-activesync-devices-and-users-in-exchange-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/02/Exchange-2010-Logo-748516_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;Recently I needed to report on the ActiveSync devices that were attached to our Exchange 2010 organisation, and which users they were accessing, and then export them to a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking through the script it gets all the mailboxes from the server MBX01, gets an object containing the ActiveSync device name, type and user agent. It then adds a property to that object called “MailboxIdentity” and adds it to that object. That object is then added to an array of objects called ActiveSyncDevices, which is then exported to CSV.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating/Enabling Exchange 2010 Personal Archives</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/creatingenabling-exchange-2010-personal-archives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2010 13:32:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/creatingenabling-exchange-2010-personal-archives/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/09/Exchange2010Logo748516_thumb2.png" alt=""&gt; With the release of Exchange 2010 SP1, administrators can now use separate Mailbox Databases to store the Personal Archives of users – this is particularly useful if you have some larger, slower (and probably by virtue, older) storage that’s not really up to the I/O of your Exchange Server (that old SAN/NAS sitting in the corner of the server room?). It’s also useful if you just don’t have the capacity on your main storage.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing Exchange 2010 SP1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/installing-exchange-2010-sp1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 11:23:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/09/installing-exchange-2010-sp1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/09/image27_thumb.png" alt=""&gt; Exchange SP1 has now been released, so I thought I’d document the upgrade process for my small Exchange 2010 organisation, consisting of one CAS/Transport/Mailbox server, and an Edge Transport server.&lt;/p&gt;

So far the roles installed for Exchange 2010 are CAS, Hub and Mailbox on a single server.

&lt;p&gt;If you’re having trouble accessing OWA after updating Exchange 2010 with any of the Rollup packages, try this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uninstall the update package from the Programs and Features control panel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the package file directly from Microsoft, don’t use Windows Update&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a command prompt or PowerShell prompt as Administrator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the location of the package (.msp) and run from the elevated command prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently when Windows update installs the package it doesn’t run it with the elevated privileges to write to the folder in the Exchange program files – why, I have no idea!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Testing access to your Exchange services with Microsoft Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/testing-access-to-your-exchange-services-with-microsoft-exchange-remote-connectivity-analyzer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2010 09:27:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/testing-access-to-your-exchange-services-with-microsoft-exchange-remote-connectivity-analyzer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Microsoft Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; is perhaps the best tool I’ve used in a long time for troubleshooting Exchange external access – it just works!

&lt;p&gt;The environment is a single AD domain with 4 sites, Site1, Site2, Site3 and Site4. In Site1, Site2 and Site3 there are 3 Exchange 2003 servers, one per site. In Site4 there is an Exchange 2007 SP2 server (CAS, Mailbox, HT). All the connectors required worked as expected, and inter-site routing works as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I introduced into the mix a 2010 Enterprise server (CAS, Mailbox, HT) to Site1 as a prelude to a full upgrade of the site to Exchange 2010. When a test mailbox from Exchange 2010 attempts to send to a mailbox in Site1 Exchange 2003, it routes via the Site4 Exchange 2007.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exchange ActiveSync fails on iPhone after upgrade to iOS4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 15:55:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent a fair bit of time today trying to sort out my iPhone sync to my Exchange Server, failing miserably.

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPhone fails to sync, generic timeout error (or is very slow)&lt;/li&gt;

Something that confused me slightly for a few minutes was this: if there is an existing Move Request (pending, in progress, failed or completed) you will not see the “New Local Move Request” or “New Remote Move Request” -&lt;/p&gt;
