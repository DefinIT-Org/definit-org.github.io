&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regret to inform you that your attempt to achieve VCDX certification on June 09-11, 2015 in Frimley, UK was unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;rsquo;t entirely unexpected, but somehow I still hoped my assessment of the defense was pessimistic and so it was nonetheless disappointing. It&amp;rsquo;s a big hit to not achieve something I have been focusing on for months and it is hard not to feel embarrassed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the grade. I am looking forward to receiving some feedback from the panelists and will be gearing up for another attempt in October.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
