When can we have it installed by?”
The problem is, once they’ve purchased licensing for Exchange 2010 and installed and configured the server, migrated the users’ mailboxes and decommissioned the old Exchange 2003 server, the Online Archive feature is not available.</description></item><item><title>Syncing email, calendar and tasks over a laptop, desktop and iPhone</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/12/syncing-email-calendar-and-tasks-over-a-laptop-desktop-and-iphone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2009 16:58:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/12/syncing-email-calendar-and-tasks-over-a-laptop-desktop-and-iphone/</guid><description>In the past, I would often say to my wife, “if it’s not in Outlook, it isn’t going to happen”. Increasingly it’s “if it’s not on my iPhone, it’s not going to happen”. The fact is that I can’t actually remember all the things that I need to do each day, I need reminding!
I spend perhaps 8 hours a day at my work PC, maybe 2 hours a day on my home laptop and my iPhone is with me pretty much 24/7 – all of which are both data sources, and data endpoints.</description></item></channel></rss>
