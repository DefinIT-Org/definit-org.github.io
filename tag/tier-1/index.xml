I am learning NSX-T, part of my learning is to deploy in my lab - if I contradict the official docs then go with the docs!
Lab Environment This NSX-T lab environment is built as a nested lab on my physical hosts. There are four physical ESXi hosts, onto which I will deploy three ESXi VMs, a vCenter Server Appliance, NSX Manager, an NSX Controller cluster, and two NSX Edge Nodes.</description></item><item><title>#vROps a new diva in the datacentre</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-a-new-diva-in-the-datacentre/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:06:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-a-new-diva-in-the-datacentre/</guid><description>For the last few months and certainly very recently (at the London VMUG meeting) I have had the chance to talk to peers and #vExperts and share “war stories” with regards to vRealize Operations Manager.
What has become a consistent theme in all the stories is just how much compute resources vROps requires when you “go big” and not just what is clearly defined in the sizing spreadsheet.
For example some of the large deployments I have either been involved in or heard about (to monitor upwards and beyond of 30000 VMs) required the deployment of Large vROps nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
