&lt;h2 id="multi-cloud-builder"&gt;Multi-Cloud Builder &lt;a class="anchor" href="#multi-cloud-builder"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course took place over 4 days and was very well structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialy, we were given the VMware vision on Multi-Cloud and then we were straight into the &amp;ldquo;good stuff&amp;rdquo; hands-on-labs. This would be a consistent and well executed theme for the 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware now have an impressive global cloud presence utilising their partnerships with major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and several others. You can see from the list below VMware are serious about this Multi-Cloud journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware Aria - Unified Multi-Cloud Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/09/vmware-aria-unified-multi-cloud-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/09/vmware-aria-unified-multi-cloud-management/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;VMWorld, sorry VMware Explore has been and gone and seemed to go very smoothly, there were several announcements but the big one for me was Aria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vmware-aria-formerly-vrealize-cloud-management"&gt;VMware Aria (formerly vRealize Cloud Management) &lt;a class="anchor" href="#vmware-aria-formerly-vrealize-cloud-management"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Cloud management that unifies applications, infrastructure, and services across private, hybrid, and public clouds in a single platform with a common data model.&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;With the VMware Aria launch, we are unifying VMware Cloud Management in four key respects:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
