Failed to load SRA from &amp;lsquo;C:/Program Files/VMware/VMware vCenter Site Recovery Manager/storage/sra/EMC VNXe SRA&amp;rsquo;. SRA command &amp;lsquo;queryInfo&amp;rsquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t return a response.
The components installed (in this order) are:
vSphere 5.5 SRM 5.5 UNISphere CLI 1.5.4.1.0027-1 VNXe SRA 5.0.0 The root cause is that the system locale is EN-GB rather than EN-US, however even changing the locale does not resolve the issue.</description></item><item><title>#LonVMUG 15th May &amp;ndash; another great VMUG!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/lonvmug-15th-may-another-great-vmug/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2014 09:44:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/lonvmug-15th-may-another-great-vmug/</guid><description>Yesterday saw another fantastic London VMUG with lots of quality sessions and opportunities to network with peers and friends. The committee seem to do a fantastic job every time and this one was no exception, so thanks to Alaric Davies, Jane Rimmer, Stuart Thompson and Simon Gallagher!
One of the best things for me about the VMUG is the chance to chat with some of the smartest and most influential people in the VMware world – a trip to the coffee table provided a great opportunity to “chew the vfat” with two of the VMUG&amp;rsquo;s biggest characters, Mike Laverick and Ricky El-Qasem – all before any sessions had started.</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware Site Recovery Manager (SRM) 5.5 in the Lab</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/installing-vmware-site-recovery-manager-srm-5-5-in-the-lab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 12:04:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/installing-vmware-site-recovery-manager-srm-5-5-in-the-lab/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing about with a compact SRM install in my lab - since I have limited resources and only one site I wanted to create a run-through for anyone learning SRM to be able to do it in their own lab too. I am creating two sites on the same IP subnet (pretend it&amp;rsquo;s a stretched LAN across two sites) and will be protecting a single, tiny Linux web server using vSphere Replication.</description></item><item><title>Generating and Installing CA Signed Certificates for VMware SRM 5.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/generating-and-installing-ca-signed-certificates-for-vmware-srm-5-5/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 10:11:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/generating-and-installing-ca-signed-certificates-for-vmware-srm-5-5/</guid><description>I’m fairly new to SRM, but even so this one seemed like a real head-scratcher! If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see SRM Authentication).</description></item></channel></rss>
