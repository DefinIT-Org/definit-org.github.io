Some of the examples include, vROps Policies, Alert Definitions, Automated Action Framework, integration to third party etc. This would include power point and live demonstrations. The session would range anywhere between 60 to 90 minutes.
With 100+ registrations and more than 70 live attendees, it was definitely a great start to this series.</description></item><item><title>Starting 2016 with a bang &amp;ndash; #vROps Webinar Series</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/starting-2016-with-a-bang-vrops-webinar-series/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2016 15:12:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/starting-2016-with-a-bang-vrops-webinar-series/</guid><description>With a new year comes new things and I am delighted to announce the start of a vROps based webinar series.
