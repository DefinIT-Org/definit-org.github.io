After a lot of attempts to get in contact with F5 for a 90-day trial of the full version, or to purchase a lab license, I came up empty handed. The free version you can download from F5&amp;rsquo;s website is version 11.3, which does not feature the iControl REST API, which was released in 11.4.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
