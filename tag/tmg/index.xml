To comply with DR, all 3 servers must have their configurations up to date, however there is no direct communication allowed between the two DMZs, so simply adding to the new server as an array member is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>More notes on Threat Management Gateway Arrays</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/08/more-notes-on-threat-management-gateway-arrays/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2011 19:57:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/08/more-notes-on-threat-management-gateway-arrays/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/03/TMG2010.png" alt=""&gt;It seems that despite my previous &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/installing-exchange-2010-edge-server-with-forefront-protection-for-exchange-fpe-and-threat-management-gateway-tmg-part-1/" title="Installing Exchange 2010 Edge Server with Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) – Part 1"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/configuring-sstp-vpn-connections-threat-management-gateway-2010/" title="Configuring SSTP VPN connections to Threat Management Gateway 2010"&gt;TMG 2010&lt;/a&gt;, I still stumble when &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/in-depth-installing-and-configuring-threat-management-gateway-2010-in-a-network-load-balanced-array/" title="In-depth: Installing and Configuring Threat Management Gateway 2010 in a Network Load Balanced Array"&gt;creating a TMG array&lt;/a&gt;.

There are some half-working solutions I’ve seen, but nothing that worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process involves simply opening the correct ports and protocols between the TMG servers and the SCOM management servers, which after a few attempts watching the live logs, I found.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>In-depth: Installing and Configuring Threat Management Gateway 2010 in a Network Load Balanced Array</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/in-depth-installing-and-configuring-threat-management-gateway-2010-in-a-network-load-balanced-array/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 16:35:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/in-depth-installing-and-configuring-threat-management-gateway-2010-in-a-network-load-balanced-array/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; In this post I will be installing a TMG Array as a “back firewall” behind a hardware firewall. The Array will consist of two virtual servers, TMG01 and TMG02 which each have 3 NICs. One NIC will be dedicated to the LAN network, accessible internally. One NIC will be dedicated to the DMZ network, accessible to the outside world on a static mapped IP. The third NIC will be a dedicated intra-array communications NIC as per Microsoft’s recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing Exchange 2010 Edge Server with Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) – Part 1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/installing-exchange-2010-edge-server-with-forefront-protection-for-exchange-fpe-and-threat-management-gateway-tmg-part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 13:59:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/installing-exchange-2010-edge-server-with-forefront-protection-for-exchange-fpe-and-threat-management-gateway-tmg-part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I am mid-migration, in a co-existence setup with Exchange 2010, 2007 and 2003. So far the roles installed for Exchange 2010 are CAS, Hub and Mailbox on a single server. Into this mix I need to introduce an Edge Server, with message hygiene in the form of Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) as a reverse proxy to publish OWA, ActiveSync et-al.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
