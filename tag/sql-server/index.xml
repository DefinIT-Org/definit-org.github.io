One of the limitations that caused headaches was that it used to have a maximum storage of 4GB, which was the database limit. If you wanted to go larger, you would need either a) multiple SPS installations, b) a full version of SQL server, or c) the full version of MOSS. None of those solutions are particularly cost effective, and for a small company cost is king.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Server 2008 – Reporting Services Error The permissions granted to user DOMAIN\USER are insufficient for performing this operation.

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note – this configuration will work for ESXi 4 upwards due to the server 2008 MSCS requirement for persistent SCSI-3 reservations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to create a new vSwitch for the host-only cluster heartbeat network, don’t assign any network adaptors to the switch as it’s going to be local only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a new virtual machine with a single hard disk. For the purposes of this test, I’ve assigned 2 vProcessors, 1GB RAM, 30GB drive for the OS, 1 vNIC in the default vSwitch0.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to configure Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and SQL 2005 to use more then 4GB RAM</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/10/how-to-configure-windows-server-2003-enterprise-and-sql-2005-to-use-more-then-4gb-ram/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2008 11:43:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/10/how-to-configure-windows-server-2003-enterprise-and-sql-2005-to-use-more-then-4gb-ram/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;32-bit processors have a limitation of only being able to directly address 4GB RAM - their architecture was never designed to address more. 64-bit processors get around that limitation by being able to us 64 bits to address RAM (potentially 16,777,216 GB), but what do you do if you have an application that won&amp;rsquo;t work on a 64-bit copy of Windows, but does need to utilise more than 4GB of RAM?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
