At that point I was content to live the contractor life for a year or so and see what opportunities came along. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect opportunity to come along so quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I&amp;rsquo;m joining VMware as part of the PSO NSX practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression. And NSX is a rocket-ship that is gathering speed and momentum, it&amp;rsquo;s viewed by many as critical to the future of VMware as the public cloud begins to eat the more traditional datacenter. With so much focus on NSX at VMworld this year, I am convinced of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When everyones an Architect.. no one is..</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/when-everyones-an-architect-no-one-is/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2016 10:34:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/when-everyones-an-architect-no-one-is/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I think this is the first time I have written a &amp;ldquo;rant&amp;rdquo; post (for a while at least) so if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to hear me whine run away now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past 12 months I think I have met more folk with Architect in their job title than I truly believe is valid. Now I will be clear this is not a slight on the individuals all of them have been exceptional (at least the ones I have had the pleasure to work with).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
