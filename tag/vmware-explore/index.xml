I feel very blessed to have attended in 2014 (EU), 2015 (EU), 2016 (US), 2017 (EU), 2018 (my first as an employee), 2019 (my first time as a speaker!), and virtually in 2020 and 2021.
Over the years VMworld has been hugely formative in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked many times before about how the trajectory of my career really took off when I got involved with the London VMUG, and how that led to being awarded vExpert in 2013.</description></item></channel></rss>
