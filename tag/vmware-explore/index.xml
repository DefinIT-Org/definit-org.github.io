 first VMworld
&lt;/a&gt; was almost 9 years ago! I feel very blessed to have attended in &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-day-one/"&gt;
 2014 (EU)
&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-pre-event-and-partner-day/"&gt;
 2015 (EU)
&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/heading-to-vmworld-us-2016/"&gt;
 2016 (US)
&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-before-i-go/"&gt;
 2017 (EU)
&lt;/a&gt;, 2018 (my first as an employee), 2019 (my first time as a speaker!), and virtually in 2020 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years VMworld has been hugely formative in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked many times before about how the trajectory of my career really took off when I got involved with the London VMUG, and how that led to being awarded vExpert in 2013. Through the vExpert programme, I got my first blogger pass for VMworld, and from there the networking opportunities led to certification, career advances, and ultimately making the contacts (and friends) that got me in the door at VMware. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate how much VMworld has helped over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
