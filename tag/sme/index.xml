 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; GA today
&lt;/a&gt; and from what I have seen so far I do think VSAN is a great product and I think VMware have done a superb job with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-many-&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; discussions on twitter and other channels regarding the then lack of licensing information and pricing I was eager to see if VMware would offer a &amp;ldquo;foundation&amp;rdquo; VSAN option for SMB/SME&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vCHS – first impressions</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/vchs-first-impressions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2014 13:39:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/02/vchs-first-impressions/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/02/vCHS-Powered.png" alt=""&gt;In case you missed it VMware have now released &lt;a href="http://www.vmwareforyou.com/vchs/" title="vCHS" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; vCHS
&lt;/a&gt; (VMware vCloud Hybrid Service) in Europe! The first data center residing in Slough with more data centers planned across Europe in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in an SME that has several existing vSphere environments this was of real interest, as the need to scale out quickly from our Private clouds is rapidly becoming a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having already spoken to VMware on the phone to get a rough idea on options and costs I decided to take a look at the &lt;a href="http://labs.hol.vmware.com/" title="Hands on Labs" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; Hands-on-labs
&lt;/a&gt; to see how easy it really is to use and migrate VMs from an existing private cloud to vCHS.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
