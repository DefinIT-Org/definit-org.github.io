I downloaded the source, compiled it, added a reference to the dll in my project and tapped away for a few minutes and et voila, within a few minutes a working screen scrape. A fantastic library.</description></item><item><title>Restoring the ASP.NET tab in IIS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/restoring-the-asp-net-tab-in-iis/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2008 18:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/04/restoring-the-asp-net-tab-in-iis/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve logged onto the properties for your IIS install and found that the ASP.NET tab has mysteriously disappered, you can try a couple of things.
Firstly, try re-registering ASP.NET with IIS using the ASPNET_REGIIS.exe located in the .NET installation folder:
c:\WINDOWS\MICROSOFT.NET\framework\\aspnet_regiis -i &amp;nbsp; Chances are though, that it won't work, and that you can try and number of command using aspnet_regiis.exe or even uninstalling and reinstalling .NET and you won't actually fix the problem.</description></item><item><title>Installing Visual Studio 2003 SP1 on Vista</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-sp1-on-vista/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2007 19:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-sp1-on-vista/</guid><description>I’ve finally cracked the installation problems with VS 2003 SP1 on Vista. The problem seems to be that the SP must be installed under the same credentials that Visual Studio was installed. I.e. I installed Visual Studio under the domain administrator credentials, but I run my day-to-day under a standard user credential. When installing the SP1 I was elevating my standard user credential rather than running as the domain admin. I don’t know what difference that makes to anything, but it’s worked!</description></item><item><title>Visual Studio Project Location Not Trusted</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/visual-studio-project-location-not-trusted/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jun 2007 19:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/visual-studio-project-location-not-trusted/</guid><description>Just a quick post today about trust levels for .NET assemblies that are hosted remotely. My current set up at work means that I am maintaining one version of our web site while working on developing a new one - not uncommon. I have 2 virtual servers running Server 2003, IIS and SQL Server, each an identical copy of our production server. Each solution and it&amp;rsquo;s projects are stored on each virtual server, with the project folders shared and mapped as drives on my laptop.</description></item><item><title>Installing Visual Studio 2003 on Vista Enterprise</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-on-vista-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2007 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-on-vista-enterprise/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as you might imagine if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be developing on a local machine. The pre-requisites include IIS and FrontPage Server Extensions which will need installing. Install IIS on Vista Go through Control Panel, Programs and Features, then select &amp;ldquo;Turn Windows features on or off&amp;rdquo; on the left hand menu. The basic installation of Vista from the control panel will not be sufficient for a VS install, you must add&amp;nbsp;IIS Metabase Compatibility (you&amp;rsquo;ll see why later),&amp;nbsp;.</description></item></channel></rss>
