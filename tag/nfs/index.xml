They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card. SD cards are notorious for having high attrition rates, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re reading/writing to them regularly. Running a Kubernetes cluster on my Raspberry Pis is especially hard on the SD card because you&amp;rsquo;re not only running the system&amp;rsquo;s read and writes, but you&amp;rsquo;re also running containers and their I/O on the card.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Infinio accelerator – quick review</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/infinio-accelerator-quick-review/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2014 12:31:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/infinio-accelerator-quick-review/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/04/infinio_logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;I recently came across Infinio and after reading about the unique way it tackled the problem of increasing I/O and reducing latency I was curious to see how it would perform in my lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things I would like to point out. First of all Infinio works &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;only with NFS storage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, secondly it &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;does not require flash storage&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; as it utilizes the host RAM instead however it provides &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;only&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;read acceleration&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Book review: Networking for VMware Administrators</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2014 09:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I recently got my hands on a copy* of Chris Wahl and Steve Pantol’s Networking for VMware Administrators and was very keen to read it – especially given the reputation of the authors. I came to the book as someone who is at CCNA level (although now expired) and someone who regularly designs complex VMware networks using standard and distributed switches. I would class myself as having a fairly decent understanding of networking, though not a networking specialist.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
