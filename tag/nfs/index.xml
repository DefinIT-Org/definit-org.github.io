They&amp;rsquo;re phenominal little bits of kit, endlessly hackable and because of their really low price, they open up computing to a huge number of people who otherwise wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get the opportunity.
One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card.</description></item><item><title>PXE Booting Raspberry Pi 4 with Synology and Ubiquiti EdgeRouter</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/pxe-booting-raspberry-pi-4-with-synology-and-ubiquiti-edgerouter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/pxe-booting-raspberry-pi-4-with-synology-and-ubiquiti-edgerouter/</guid><description>I love Raspbery Pis - I have done since they first released them, all the way up to the present iteration, the Raspberry Pi 4.

A few things I would like to point out. First of all Infinio works only with NFS storage, secondly it does not require flash storage as it utilizes the host RAM instead however it provides only read acceleration.</description></item><item><title>Book review: Networking for VMware Administrators</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2014 09:34:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/04/book-review-networking-for-vmware-administrators/</guid><description>I recently got my hands on a copy* of Chris Wahl and Steve Pantol’s Networking for VMware Administrators and was very keen to read it – especially given the reputation of the authors. I came to the book as someone who is at CCNA level (although now expired) and someone who regularly designs complex VMware networks using standard and distributed switches. I would class myself as having a fairly decent understanding of networking, though not a networking specialist.</description></item></channel></rss>
