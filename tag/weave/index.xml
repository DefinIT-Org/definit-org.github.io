For the last year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been running all my home kubernetes workloads on a Raspberry Pi cluster - and it&amp;rsquo;s been working really well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been through several iterations - for example firstly running on SD cards (tl;dr - it&amp;rsquo;s bad, they wear out really fast with Kubernetes on board!), then &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/pxe-booting-raspberry-pi-4-with-synology-and-ubiquiti-edgerouter/"&gt;PxE booting them from my Synology&lt;/a&gt; to it&amp;rsquo;s now current state of booting directly from SSDs. I&amp;rsquo;ve also moved from Raspberry Pi 3s to 4s, I&amp;rsquo;ve played around with stacking cluster cases before landing on the current rack-mount format.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
