It is an import limitation to be aware of if you plan to adjust your pNIC configuration of any VCF hosts post deployment/commisioning.
The Problem We have a few customers who will not be able to commision their new hosts with the desired pNIC configuration due to current hardware availability.</description></item></channel></rss>
