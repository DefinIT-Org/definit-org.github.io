You can check out the release notes here https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T/2.1/rn/VMware-NSX-T-21-Release-Notes.html
As I&amp;rsquo;m mid-way through this blog series, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d stick in the upgrade as a little bonus!
Download the upgrade bundle Validate the version and status of NSX-T components Check the Controller cluster status and Manager connections are up.
Validate the hosts are installed, and have a connection to the controller and manager.</description></item><item><title>NST-T 2.0 Lab Build: Logical Router Configuration</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nst-t-2-0-lab-build-logical-router-config/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2017 14:48:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nst-t-2-0-lab-build-logical-router-config/</guid><description>Disclaimer!
