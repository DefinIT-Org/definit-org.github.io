At the time it was just a self-learning and self-documentation exercise, but after few short months Sam started noticing an increasae in traffic and that people were commenting on the posts he wrote. From that point on the blog became about helping other people who were hitting the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2011 and Sam invited &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/authors/simon-eady"&gt;Simon Eady&lt;/a&gt; to join and co-author on the site, creating a wider set of expertise but still with the same goal of sharing the knowledge and helping people just like us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2025/10/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-003-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2025/10/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-003-exam-experience/</guid><description>My experience taking the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003) exam — preparation, exam process, and thoughts on why certification still matters.</description></item><item><title>DefinIT - A relaunch of sorts</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2025/05/definit-a-relaunch-of-sorts/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2025/05/definit-a-relaunch-of-sorts/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back and realised the last time I posted here was July 2022—almost three years ago! It’s hard to believe how quickly that time has flown. Consider this post a signal of intent: I’m planning to start publishing content here once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="so-why-did-i-stop"&gt;So, why did I stop? &lt;a class="anchor" href="#so-why-did-i-stop"&gt;
 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a fair question. The truth is, I didn’t stop creating content—I just stopped publishing it here.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Looking forward to VMware Explore - the artist formerly known as VMworld</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/07/looking-forward-to-vmware-explore-the-artist-formerly-known-as-vmworld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/07/looking-forward-to-vmware-explore-the-artist-formerly-known-as-vmworld/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that my &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vmworld-europe-2013-arriving-and-day-1/"&gt;first VMworld&lt;/a&gt; was almost 9 years ago! I feel very blessed to have attended in &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-day-one/"&gt;2014 (EU)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-pre-event-and-partner-day/"&gt;2015 (EU)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/heading-to-vmworld-us-2016/"&gt;2016 (US)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/sams-vmworld-2017-before-i-go/"&gt;2017 (EU)&lt;/a&gt;, 2018 (my first as an employee), 2019 (my first time as a speaker!), and virtually in 2020 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years VMworld has been hugely formative in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked many times before about how the trajectory of my career really took off when I got involved with the London VMUG, and how that led to being awarded vExpert in 2013. Through the vExpert programme, I got my first blogger pass for VMworld, and from there the networking opportunities led to certification, career advances, and ultimately making the contacts (and friends) that got me in the door at VMware. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to overstate how much VMworld has helped over the years.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Forwarding Tanzu Kubernetes Grid logs to vRealize Log Insight Cloud using the Fluent-bit Package</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/forwarding-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-logs-to-vrealize-log-insight-cloud-using-the-fluent-bit-package/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/forwarding-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-logs-to-vrealize-log-insight-cloud-using-the-fluent-bit-package/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post I walked through &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/"&gt;configuring kubernetes ingress with automatically generated SSL certificates and DNS registration&lt;/a&gt; using Tanzu Kubernetes Grid&amp;rsquo;s Packages. Another of the packaged applications available is Fluent-bit, which enables log forwarding from your Kubernetes cluster and workloads to a range of supported logging endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of tweaks required in order to forward logs to vRealize Automation Log Insight Cloud. We need to use the HTTP output in the Fluent Bit configuration to forward the logs as a JSON payload to the Log Insight API. We also need to append an authentication header with an API key, and configure some tags so that the Tanzu Kubnernetes Grid Content Pack will pick up the logs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ingress, SSL and DNS using TKG 1.4 Packages on TKGs Clusters</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So, you&amp;rsquo;ve set up your shiny new Workload Management on vSphere, created a Namespace and deployed a cluster&amp;hellip;now what?!

&lt;p&gt;Virtual conference event fatigue is real. I have attended and presented at many since the pandemic began, with varying levels of engagement. As an introvert, I can&amp;rsquo;t quite believe I&amp;rsquo;m saying this, but I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get pack to meeting up with people in the real world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of a conference is super-charged by the mix of dedicated time, networking opportunities and quality live content. Unfortunately for me a virtual conference tends to be diluted by distractions on-screen (and off) and is missing the key ingredient of those haphazard incidental meetups in the conference center. And whether you prefer on-demand pre-recorded content or not, for me it loses some of it&amp;rsquo;s appeal when you know the mistakes are edited out. And yes, I edit out my mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Workaround: Adding an external vRealize Orchestrator 8.x instance to Code Stream</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/workaround-adding-an-external-vrealize-orchestrator-8.x-instance-to-code-stream/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/06/workaround-adding-an-external-vrealize-orchestrator-8.x-instance-to-code-stream/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I was doing some testing with adding an external vRealize Orchestrator 8.4 endpoint to vRealize Automation Code Stream 8.4, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a redirect that happens with the vRO 8.4 appliance that makes the endpoint validation fail.

However, applications being applications, sometimes they become less responsive than they should (or for example, when my Synology updates itself and reboots, any mounted NFS volumes can cause the running pods to degrade in performance). This isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue with service liveliness, which can be mitigated with a &lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-a-liveness-command"&gt;liveness probe&lt;/a&gt; that restarts the pod if a service isn&amp;rsquo;t running.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Automatically adding Kubernetes Service DNS records to Microsoft DNS using CoreDNS and k8s_gateway</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/12/automatically-adding-kubernetes-service-dns-records-to-microsoft-dns-using-coredns-and-k8s_gateway/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/12/automatically-adding-kubernetes-service-dns-records-to-microsoft-dns-using-coredns-and-k8s_gateway/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;When I deploy a new service into a namespace, I need to create a new DNS record that makes it available.

&lt;p&gt;To do this I will create a delegated zone under my existing zone &lt;code&gt;cmbu.local&lt;/code&gt; that CoreDNS will be responsible for.

A more repeatable way is to create a Custom Integration that takes the two inputs, and returns the encoded header as an output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the Custom Integration:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Custom Integration named &amp;ldquo;Create Basic Authentication Header&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Runtime - the examples below are &lt;code&gt;shell&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; respectively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the placeholder code with the example from below&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save and version the Custom Integration, ensuring you eanble the &amp;ldquo;Release Version&amp;rdquo; toggle&lt;/li&gt;

For the most part, I try and keep my applications and configurations stateless - relying on &lt;code&gt;ConfigMaps&lt;/code&gt; for example to store application configuration. This means with a handful of YAML files in my Git repository I can restore everything to working order. Sometimes though, there&amp;rsquo;s no choice but to use a &lt;code&gt;PersistentVolume&lt;/code&gt; to provide some data persistance where you can&amp;rsquo;t capture it in a config file.

&lt;p&gt;One of the irritating things, though, about running Raspberry Pis is that they typically boot from an SD card. SD cards are notorious for having high attrition rates, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re reading/writing to them regularly. Running a Kubernetes cluster on my Raspberry Pis is especially hard on the SD card because you&amp;rsquo;re not only running the system&amp;rsquo;s read and writes, but you&amp;rsquo;re also running containers and their I/O on the card.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vExpert 2020 holographic sticker charity giveaway!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/vexpert-2020-holographic-sticker-charity-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/03/vexpert-2020-holographic-sticker-charity-giveaway/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; - the first 50 vExperts to sign up on &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/adfsWN29boZBhMDT6"&gt;this google sheet&lt;/a&gt; and then make a &lt;a href="https://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/SamMcGeown"&gt;donation to my fundraiser here&lt;/a&gt; or another charity of your choice will get a nice shiny new vExpert 2020 sticker!&lt;/p&gt;

So, in an effort to reduce my carbon footprint (and electricity bill) I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for ways to shut down my lab when it&amp;rsquo;s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using GitLab Pipelines to deploy Hugo sites to AWS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/using-gitlab-pipelines-to-deploy-hugo-sites-to-aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/01/using-gitlab-pipelines-to-deploy-hugo-sites-to-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve posted previously about &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/04/goodbye-wordpress-hello-hugo/"&gt;moving to Hugo as a publishing platform for this blog&lt;/a&gt;, this post is a bit more about how I&amp;rsquo;m managing the publishing using GitLab&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD Pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I need to mention that I&amp;rsquo;m using three different repositories for my code base, and why. The three repositories are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definit-hugo - this contains the hugo site configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definit-content - this contains the site content - markdown files, images etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;definit-theme - this contains the VMware Clarity-based theme I use for my site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;definit-content&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;definit-theme&lt;/strong&gt; are git submodules in the &lt;strong&gt;definit-hugo&lt;/strong&gt; project, mapped into the /content and /themes folders respectively. This allows me to keep the configuration, content and theme separate, and to manage them as separate entities. The aim is that the theme will eventually be in a position to be released, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to extract it from my hugo code base later on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Goodbye VMware PSO...</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/09/goodbye-vmware-pso.../</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/09/goodbye-vmware-pso.../</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Autumn seems to be a time for the winds of change to blow through our industry, and this year that&amp;rsquo;s true for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - I&amp;rsquo;m leaving VMware PSO to join the Cloud Management Business Unit as a Technical Marketing Manager for Cloud Automation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over two years since I joined VMware as a Senior Conusltant in the EMEA NSX Practice, and in that time I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed some great opportunities, worked with some great people and technologies. And I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot since taking on my first NSX-T design just days after joining. But, as I &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/the-next-big-thing/"&gt;mentioned when I joined a couple of years ago&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve always said NSX comes alive when it&amp;rsquo;s automated by vRA. In fact, almost every engagement I&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past two years has had a strong vein of automation running through it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lab Guide - Kubernetes Load Balancer and Ingress with MetalLB and Contour</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/08/lab-guide-kubernetes-load-balancer-and-ingress-with-metallb-and-contour/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/08/lab-guide-kubernetes-load-balancer-and-ingress-with-metallb-and-contour/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I run quite a few applications in Docker as part of my home network - there&amp;rsquo;s a small selection below, but at any one time there might be 10-15 more apps I&amp;rsquo;m playing around with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plex - Streaming media server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unifi - Ubiquiti Network Controller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;homebridge - Apple Homekit compatible smart home integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;influxdb - Open source time series database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grafana - Data visualization &amp;amp; Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pihole - internet tracking and ad blocker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vault - Hashicorp secret management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently a single PhotonOS VM with Docker was all I needed to run - everything shared the same host IP, stored it&amp;rsquo;s configuration locally or on an NFS mount and generally ran fine. However, my wife and kids have become more dependant on plex, and homebridge (which I use to control the air conditioning in my house), and if they&amp;rsquo;re down, it&amp;rsquo;s a problem. So, I embarked on a little project to provide some better availability, and learn a little in the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lab Guide - Kubernetes and Storage with the vSphere Cloud Provider - Step by Step</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/06/lab-guide-kubernetes-and-storage-with-the-vsphere-cloud-provider-step-by-step/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/06/lab-guide-kubernetes-and-storage-with-the-vsphere-cloud-provider-step-by-step/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from me recent post &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/06/lab-guide-kubernetes-and-nsx-t-container-network-plugin-step-by-step/"&gt;deploying Kubernetes with the NSX-T

drop down a level and get more familiar with the inner workings for Kubernetes,
as well as explore some of the newer features that are exposed by the NSX
Container Plugin that are not yet in the PKS integrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSX-T docs are…not great, I certainly don’t think you can work out the steps

I’ve seen a few people this week simply shut down and delete their blogs - which is both upsetting and sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Lifecycle Manager 1.2 VC data collection fails when NSX-T hostswitches are in use</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/04/vrealize-lifecycle-manager-1-2-vc-data-collection-fails-when-nsx-t-hostswitches-are-in-use/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Apr 2018 10:17:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/04/vrealize-lifecycle-manager-1-2-vc-data-collection-fails-when-nsx-t-hostswitches-are-in-use/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;When vRealize Lifecycle Manager 1.2 was released recently, I was keen to get it installed in my lab, since I maintain several vRealize Automation deployments for development and testing, as well as performing upgrades. With vRLCM I can reduce the administrative overhead of managing the environments, as well as easily migrate content between environments (I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging on some of these cool new features soon).&lt;/p&gt;

The simple answer is that I used to make something up as I went along, deploying components by hand and generally repeating myself a lot. I had some cut/paste commands in my note application that sped things up a little, but nothing that developed. I’ve been meaning to rectify this for a while, and this is the result!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Retrieve Blueprint or Virtual Machine Custom Properties using the vRealize Automation API</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/02/retrieve-blueprint-or-virtual-machine-custom-properties-using-the-vrealize-automation-api/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2018 14:11:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2018/02/retrieve-blueprint-or-virtual-machine-custom-properties-using-the-vrealize-automation-api/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Just a quick post today, as I was working with a customer recently and we were trying to retrieve the Custom Properties assigned to a vRealize Automation 7.3 deployed Virtual Machine, similar to the one in the image below.

The current integration also enables a method to deploy micro-segmentation out of the box, based on dynamic Security Group membership and the Service Composer. This method does have some limitations, and can be inflexible for the on-going management of deployed applications. It requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of NSX and the Distributed Firewall, as well as access to the Networking and Security manager that is hosted by vCenter Server.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Upgrading to NSX-T 2.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday saw the release of NSX-T 2.1, with some new features and also some usability enhancements.

At that point I was content to live the contractor life for a year or so and see what opportunities came along. I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect opportunity to come along so quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I&amp;rsquo;m joining VMware as part of the PSO NSX practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen VMware as the place that I would end up working for a while now, having worked as a customer and a partner it seemed like a logical progression. And NSX is a rocket-ship that is gathering speed and momentum, it&amp;rsquo;s viewed by many as critical to the future of VMware as the public cloud begins to eat the more traditional datacenter. With so much focus on NSX at VMworld this year, I am convinced of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 7.3 Distributed Install – Prerequisites</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrealize-automation-7-3-distributed-install-prerequisites/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:33:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/vrealize-automation-7-3-distributed-install-prerequisites/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;As a consultant I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to design, install and configure dozens of production vRealize Automation deployments, from reasonably small Proof of Concept environments to globally-scaled multi-datacenter fully distributed behemoths. It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say, that I&amp;rsquo;ve made mistakes along the way - and learned a lot of lessons as to what makes a deployment a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, pretty much everything comes down to getting the pre-requisites right. Nothing that I&amp;rsquo;ve written here is not already documented in the official documentation, and the installation wizard does a huge amount of the work for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>So long, and thanks for all the fish…</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:06:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for Xtravirt for over 3 and a half years now, first as a Senior Consultant, and more recently as a Lead Consultant.

The diagram below shows the architecture of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying vCHA can be done in two modes - &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;. You can use Basic mode if the vCenter you want to be HA is managing the hosts it resides on - in this scenario the wizard configures your vCenter and deploys the Passive and Witness nodes for you. If you have a management cluster for your vCenter Server, or you are deploying a nested environment, you need to use the advanced mode - in this scenario you must configure your active node, deploy clones for the passive and witness nodes, then enable the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Alexa, turn on my workload cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 15:05:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I already have a vRealize Orchestrator workflow to shutdown my workload cluster.

The simple fact is that vRealize Automation has a lot of log files. Correlating these log sources to provide an overall picture is a painful, manual process - unless you have Log Insight!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Lab notes: Upgrading vSphere 6.0 and NSX 6.2 to vSphere 6.5a and NSX 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:07:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding off upgrading my lab to vSphere 6.5  because NSX 6.2.x doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it.

&lt;p&gt;The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic. Then second reason is throughput - each NSX Edge is capable of ~10Gbps throughput, but with ECMP we can have multiple NSX Edges (up to 8) providing 10Gbps each - that&amp;rsquo;s a significant performance boost.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator Workflow: shutdownVSANCluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;My vSphere lab is split into two halves - a low power management cluster, powered by 3 Intel NUCs, and a more hefty workload cluster powered by a Dell C6100 chassis with 3 nodes.

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some ideas in my lab to leverage the AWS endpoint on vRealize Automation. One of the things I needed to get working was getting Software Components working on my AWS deployed instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagram to the right shows my end-stage network - the instance deployed by vRA into AWS should be in a private subnet in my VPC, and should use my local lab DNS server and be able to access my vRA instance. This allows me to make use of the vRA guest agent for software components on the deployed VMs. I also wanted to have the deployed VMs use their local NAT gateway for internet traffic, rather than paying for the data over my VPN connection.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Creating an AWS Hardware VPN Connection with Ubiquiti EdgeRouterX</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/creating-an-aws-hardware-vpn-connection-with-ubiquiti-edgerouterx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 22:38:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/creating-an-aws-hardware-vpn-connection-with-ubiquiti-edgerouterx/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/11/Multiple_VPN_Tunnels_diagram.png" alt=""&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re working with Amazon and vRealize Automation Software Components, one of the requirements is for the Guest Agent (gugent) to talk back to the vRealize Automation APIs - the gugent polls the API for tasks it should perform, downloads them from the API and executes them, then updates the tasks with a status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that Virtual Machines deployed as EC2 instances in an AWS VPC require the ability to talk back to internal corporate networks - not something you&amp;rsquo;d want to publish on the internet! That&amp;rsquo;s where AWS&amp;rsquo;s VPN connections come in - you can create several types of VPN that allow such communication over a secure (encrypted) virtual private network.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Installing .NET core, PowerShell and PowerCLI on macOS Sierra</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/installing-net-core-powershell-and-powercli-on-macos-sierra/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2016 10:52:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/installing-net-core-powershell-and-powercli-on-macos-sierra/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/powerclicore140x140.jpg" alt=""&gt;So, this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting to write up for a while!

This workshop was this year&amp;rsquo;s equivelant, but because the session included a lot of people just getting started with vRA a lot of the time was taken to explain what vRA does, so there was no real time for the more in depth details on the new features that are coming (some already announced and in Tech Preview).

&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’ll take advantage of the cheap certifications this year - in previous years I’ve take &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-vcix-nv-exam-experience/"&gt;VCIX-NV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-vcp-nv-exam-experience/"&gt;VCP-NV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/10/vmworld-europe-2013-day-2-vcap5-dcd-exam-experience/"&gt;VCAP5-DCD&lt;/a&gt; all with great results, so it’s something I’d consider, although at this point I’m not 100% sure what exam I’d take (I’ve done a lot of betas recently!)&lt;/p&gt;

I think the problem occurred because the IP addresses were all changed and the VMs shut down, without time for the application to update the node IPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web interface was down, a &lt;em&gt;netstat -ano | grep -i “443”&lt;/em&gt; showed the service was listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;_service loginsight status|restart|stop|start _hung and then timed out on the Master node&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loginsight service was not running on the Worker nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/var/log/loginsight/runtime.log contains warning messages about “Cassandra cluster not ready yet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running /usr/lib/loginsight/application/lib/apache-cassandra-*/bin/nodetool status showed the two data nodes down (DN) and used the old IP address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the nodes were up with their new IP addresses, however Cassandra on the Master node was still looking for the old IP addresses for the Worker nodes. The Worker nodes were in a similar state, knowing their own new IP addresses but not being able to update the Master node because they didn’t have the Master node’s new IP address.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deploying F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition (VE) in AWS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/deploying-f5-big-ip-virtual-edition-ve-in-aws/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 10:00:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/deploying-f5-big-ip-virtual-edition-ve-in-aws/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Recently I was asked to develop some vRealize Orchestrator workflows against the F5 BIG-IP iControl REST API, but I was not able to test freely against a production appliance.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to configure vCloud Air as a vCloud Director host in vRealize Orchestrator in order to create some custom resource actions for Day 2 operations in vRealize Automation. What I found was that there&amp;rsquo;s *very* little information out there on how to do this, and I ended up writing my own custom resource mapping for the virtual machines to VCAC:VirtualMachine objects - at least that way I could add my resource action. But this still didn&amp;rsquo;t expose the vCloud Director functionality for those machines.

&lt;p&gt;To do this I created a new workflow &amp;ldquo;debugProperties&amp;rdquo; and added an input variable called &amp;ldquo;payload&amp;rdquo;, type Properties. Next I added a single scriptable task and cycled through the properties. Some of the properties&amp;rsquo; values are actually other properties objects, so there&amp;rsquo;s a function to test the type and iterate through if required.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Automation 7 XaaS blueprint form displays: Failed to retrieve form from provider</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/vrealize-automation-7-xaas-blueprint-form-displays-failed-to-retrieve-form-from-provider/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2016 13:47:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/03/vrealize-automation-7-xaas-blueprint-form-displays-failed-to-retrieve-form-from-provider/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;VMware KB2140539&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; where requesting an XaaS (vRealize Orchestrator) blueprint fails with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apologies in advance if this is post is a jumbled nonsense, I&amp;rsquo;m still way too excited!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I woke to the news that I have passed my VCDX-CMA!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my second attempt at VCDX and although the first failure was a painful experience, the lessons learned from it were invaluable to take into the defence the second time around. Failing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a negative experience - if there is one thing that I will take from the VCDX program it is that there is ALWAYS more I need to learn, and I can always do better. Learning has to be a way of life (in this industry especially!) and the minute you stop, you start falling back.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015: vRealize Automation 7 Briefing Notes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-vrealize-automation-7-briefing-notes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 08:20:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-vrealize-automation-7-briefing-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;@vaficionado&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;) – if that list of names doesn’t fill you with confidence for vRA.Next, then I suggest you follow them on twitter and trust me that it’s a crack team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completely automated deployment…almost. The deployment of appliances and installation of IaaS components and pre-requisites will be wizard driven, the Window Servers will need to exist and have an agent installed, and the MSSQL server will also need to be installed. Anyone who’s done a distributed vRA install will know that this is a massive improvement over the current state of affairs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The vRealize Automation appliances will be clustered automatically for core services such as identity, cafe (portal), vPostgres and embedded vRealize Orchestrator (Embedded vRO is now recommended for production).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new identity service. No more vSphere SSO or PSC – VMware Identity Management (vIDM) is a new, highly scalable and performing federated identity platform. Any SAML identity source, and more than 3m users supported per source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An initial setup wizard that creates your first tenant, configuring things like fabric groups, business groups and vSphere endpoints automatically. It will even import your existing vSphere templates as clone blueprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The old CDK is gone! Instead you can use any event within vRA that is pushed through the RabbitMQ message bus to trigger extensibility through workflow subscriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vRealize Orchestrator has a new HTML5 Control Center which is your single admin point for plugin configuration as well as adding metrics and monitoring for all workflows being executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There’s no need for unique tenant URLs – the new vIDM platform allows a single logon interface for all tenants. (Though you can keep your URLs if you want!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vIDM can also be used to control authentication from IP source, e.g. to restrict logon to a specific subnet regardless of whether the credentials are valid or not. This has some cool ramifications for having the web layer in a DMZ, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functionality is slowly being migrated from the old IaaS/DynamicOps layer to the appliance – this is fantastic news. The migrated portions (such as vSphere Endpoint configuration) are now accessible through the vRA API, as well as gaining the speed and stability that the appliances provide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new blueprint designer is awesome. Added to that what was AppD is now called App Services and allows you to take a base blueprint (e.g. a CentOS VM) and drag and drop software components that you’ve scripted on top (e.g. Apache, then PHP). You can also drag and drop XaaS (vRO workflows) onto the blueprint, as well as existing blueprints to create nested blueprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much fuller integration between NSX and vRA. There’s a whole raft of improvements in the integration between vRA and NSX – e.g. you can drag a new routed network onto a blueprint and it will automatically create a new Logical Switch and Distributed Logical Router to attach the Logical Switch to. Similarly load balancing applications is a drag and drop operation, as is applying existing security groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All blueprints can be imported and exported in YAML, which opens up exciting possibilities for storing versioned blueprints and retrieving programmatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are over 60 lifecycle events out of the box on which you can trigger Orchestrator workflows, but you can create custom filters based on properties and events to extend functionality – the only limitation is what you can imagine!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still several months of development to go between now and the GA of vRA 7 and the development seems to be moving at a great pace. Between beta 1 and beta 2 there was a huge amount of change, and even the version demoed today had new features and UI.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015: Pre-event and Partner Day</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-pre-event-and-partner-day/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2015 08:36:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-pre-event-and-partner-day/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;My trip started with a farcical attempt to fly – my 11:50am flight on Sunday didn’t leave ‘til 3:30pm, but in light of William Lam’s travel woes on the same day, I don’t think I’ll complain to heavily.

Instead the recommended layout is shown in the diagram below. One instance of postgres on the primary node becomes an active instance, replicating to the second node which is passive. In front of these a load balancer or DNS entry points to the active node only.

Traditionally, (vCAC) vRA uses the Identity Appliance and relies on vSphere HA to provide the availability of the SSO platform, but in a fully distributed HA environment that&amp;rsquo;s not really good enough. It&amp;rsquo;s also possible to use the vSphere 5.5 SSO install in a HA configuration - however, many companies are making the move to the latest version of vSphere and don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily want to maintain a 5.5 HA SSO instance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Deploying VMTurbo Virtual Health Monitor</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/deploying-vmturbo-virtual-health-monitor/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 09:43:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/deploying-vmturbo-virtual-health-monitor/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Having just welcomed VMTurbo on board as a blog sponsor, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d do a quick posting on how to deploy their free Virtual Health Monitor appliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m developing some very large, very complicated workflows for vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO), and as it&amp;rsquo;s a Java based application it will probably come as no surprise to many that the performance of the client drops off sharply as the client&amp;rsquo;s RAM usage creeps up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on some of the larger workflows, or after long sessions and heavy clipboard use, the client would become (even more) sluggish and in some cases would freeze entirely. This is particularly annoying because the vRO client has a habit of forcing itself on top of other applications - for instance Task Manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>3DES Password Based Encryption with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/3des-password-based-encryption-with-vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 21:38:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/3des-password-based-encryption-with-vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A requirement that often arises in large, complex orchestration projects is the need to encrypt and decrypt information.

I wanted to be able to chose whether special characters were used, and the length of the password - typically if the password doesn&amp;rsquo;t used special characters I would increase the length significantly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Characters should be randomly picked from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a-z&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A-Z&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a keynote on day three, and there&amp;rsquo;s definitely a &amp;ldquo;winding down&amp;rdquo; feel as people tend to arrive later (if at all) and many are…feeling the effects of the previous night shall we say!

&lt;p&gt;Day two of VMworld kicked off with a keynote session which traditionally includes demos of all that&amp;rsquo;s new. It was a well presented session with a glimpse into the sysadmin&amp;rsquo;s future with a demo of vCOps alerts popping up on Google glass. Since the sessions are available online I won&amp;rsquo;t go into detail, but it was worth a watch (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t watch the US one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My morning consisted of preparations for the VCP NV (NSX) exam, which I detailed in a previous post. Very pleased to have passed what is a difficult exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMworld 2014: VCP NV Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-vcp-nv-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 11:56:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-vcp-nv-exam-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/10/wpid-wp-1413374112925.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate to attend a VMware internal bootcamp (roughly equivalent to the ICM course) for NSX and have had experience deploying production NSX environments, so that is by far the best preparation. As always, the &lt;a href="https://mylearn.vmware.com/lcms/web/portals/certification/VCP_Blueprints/VCP-NV-Exam-Blueprint-v1_2.pdf"&gt;exam blueprint&lt;/a&gt; is crucial, you *have* to know all areas covered there.

On top of that there is the &lt;a href="http://mylearn.vmware.com/quiz.cfm?item=57466"&gt;official practice exam&lt;/a&gt; which I strongly suggest you do as it reflects the real exam well, and there are a series of fantastic &lt;a href="http://www.elasticsky.co.uk/practice-questions/"&gt;practice tests by Paul McSharry&lt;/a&gt; available while provide a decent test of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMWorld 2014: Day One</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-day-one/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2014 08:21:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/10/vmworld-2014-day-one/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2014/10/wpid-wp-1413361235057.jpeg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of a rocky start (missed my flight and the partner day due to tendonitis in my knee) I arrived in Barcelona for my 2nd VMworld Europe. I headed straight from the airport to the PernixData party and caught up with the rest of the Xtravirt guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning started as ever with a keynote address. It was a little disappointing, but not unexpected, that there were no real announcements or reveals in the keynote. It was essentially a repeat of the VMworld US keynote with a couple of new betas announced. Nothing really revolutionary, a new vCloud Air datacenter in Germany and some new partners for EVO:RAIL.

If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;SRM Authentication&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). Where the process fails is during the “configure connection” stage, if either one of your vCenter servers does not have CA signed and the other does (throws an error that they are using different authentication methods) or that you are using self-signed certificates for either SRM installation (throws an error that the certificate or CA could not be trusted).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCSA 5.5 Web Client fails to log on with &amp;ldquo;SSL certificate verification failed&amp;rdquo;</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This had me scratching my head, what seemed to be a common problem wasn’t fixed by the common solution.

&lt;p&gt;The first solution is to modify the password expiration policy for SSO.

&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to join an ESXi host to an Active Directory domain? Well you’re not going to get Group Policies applying, what you’re really doing is adding another authentication provider directly to the ESXi host. You will see a computer object created in AD, but you will still need to create a DNS entry (or configure DHCP to do it for you). What you will get is a way to audit root access to your hosts, to give administrators a single sign on for managing all aspects of your virtual environment and more options in your administrative arsenal – for example, if you’re using an AD group to manage host root access, you don’t have to log onto however many ESXi hosts you have to remove a user’s permissions, simply remove them from the group. You can keep your root passwords in a sealed envelope for emergencies! 😉&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere Security: Understanding ESXi 5.x Lockdown Mode</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/vsphere-security-understanding-esxi-5-x-lockdown-mode/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 10:05:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/09/vsphere-security-understanding-esxi-5-x-lockdown-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;This is the first article in a series of vSphere Security articles that I have planned.

&lt;p&gt;I think lockdown mode is a feature that is rarely understood, and even more rarely used.

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured that I’d stick to the Intel NUC route that I’ve gone down for &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/lab/" title="Lab"&gt;my lab&lt;/a&gt; at home – I love the NUC for its tiny form factor, silent operation and really low power consumption. There are down sides – it can only take 16GB RAM, only one mSATA disk and only has one gigabit NIC. I don’t think any of those are too big a deal for a personal lab though – certainly I’ve not had any problems building and testing VMware products on my single NUC. I’d drop in an 8GB stick of RAM and an Intel 60GB mSATA SSD per NUC – you could always go 16GB later by adding another 8GB stick in the 2nd slot. I picked the Intel mSATA disk for it’s controller and throughput figures – there are larger and cheaper ones but not with the same write performance. Since the use of SSD is massively in focus with vFlash, PernixData FVP and several other technologies, you wouldn’t want to miss out. I’ve also added an 8GB USB3 flash drive per NUC to boot ESXi from.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCAP5-DCA &amp;ndash; Achievement Unlocked!

&lt;p&gt;You can see in the screenshot below that when I create a Virtual Switch without the parameter, it creates it with 64 ports.

I had a single-pane-of-glass view of all 3 and I could manage them all from the one client. The reason for the 3 vCenter servers was segregation of LAN and DMZ networks: vCenter001 was in the LAN, vCenter002 sat in DMZ1 and vCenter003 sat in DMZ2.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VM Power On fails with error: cpuid.coresPerSocket must be a number between 1 and 8</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/vm-power-on-fails-with-error-cpuid-corespersocket-must-be-a-number-between-1-and-8/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2013 11:10:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/02/vm-power-on-fails-with-error-cpuid-corespersocket-must-be-a-number-between-1-and-8/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Had a strange one after deploying an XP VM from a template today - the VM would not power on and threw the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging around on google the error seemed to be related to over-allocating vCPUs (e.g. assigning 8 vCPUs on a VM with 4 physical CPU cores). This was a single vCPU machine on a 12 processor host, so not likely to be that! It did give me the idea that maybe the VMX had an error, so I edited the VM hardware and added an extra CPU and saved the config.

&lt;p&gt;After a couple of hours online with VMware support I took a guess at the problem. On the existing Single Sign On Configuration I have added the Active Directory domain DefinIT and in order to enable integrated authentication from the vSphere Client I moved it to the top of the list - this meant that System-Domain is no longer the default authentication domain. The SSO admin account (admin@System-Domain) is a part of that domain and so my guess is that the installer tries to authenticate using &lt;a href="mailto:admin@definit.local"&gt;admin@definit.local&lt;/a&gt; rather than System-Domain, which of course failed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCP5 – vSphere 5 Configuration Maximums Quiz in PowerShell</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Nov 2012 16:48:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/11/vcp5-vsphere-5-configuration-maximums-quiz-in-powershell/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2012/02/powershell.png" alt=""&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning my vSphere 5 config maximums before my upcoming VCP5 exam, so in a supreme effort of procrastination I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a PowerShell quiz script: here it is!&lt;/p&gt;

Since I&amp;rsquo;ve got to do this for quite a few VirtualCenter Servers, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d script the certificate generation if nothing else.

In other words, from &lt;a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/09/vcenter-single-sign-on-part-1-what-is-vcenter-single-sign-on.html"&gt;VMware&amp;rsquo;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multisite deployments are  where a local replica is maintained at remote sites of the primary vCenter Single Sign-On instance. vCenter Servers are reconfigured to use the local vCenter Single Sign-On service and reduce authentication requests across the WAN. Multisite deployments do drop the support of single pane of glass views unless Linked Mode is utilized and multisite deployments are actually required to maintain Linked Mode configurations where roles, permissions and licenses are replicated between linked vCenter servers. Linked mode will re-enable single pane of glass views across multisite instances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DataStore conflicts with an existing DataStore in the DataCenter – Manually disabling Storage I/O Control</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2012 15:31:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/datastore-conflicts-with-an-existing-datastore-in-the-datacenter-manually-disabling-storage-io-control/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;I ran into this issue yesterday while reconnecting hosts in our vCenter Server following a complete reinstall - the reasons for which are a long story, but suffice to say that there were new certificates and the host passwords were encrypted with the old ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LUNs had been unpresented at the hardware level by the storage team, but had not been unmounted or removed from vCenter.

The &amp;ldquo;Tags&amp;rdquo; are organised into categories to &amp;ldquo;define how the tags can be applied to inventory objects&amp;rdquo;. The easiest way to think of the difference is that custom attributes are &amp;ldquo;free text&amp;rdquo; and the tags are statically defined properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wizard for converting custom attributes to tags, but it can get a bit confusing and is pretty poor - let me explain. We use four custom attributes in my current environment: CreatedBy, CreatedOn, Owner and ServiceType. CreatedBy contains the user ID of the person who created the VM, CreatedOn is the timestamp of when the VM was created, Owner is the Business Unit who own the server and ServiceType is the type of service - e.g. Active Directory, or SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vSphere HA agent for host [Host’s Name] has an error in [Cluster’s Name] in [Datacenter’s Name]: vSphere HA agent cannot be correctly installed or configured</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/vsphere-ha-agent-for-host-hosts-name-has-an-error-in-clusters-name-in-datacenters-name-vsphere-ha-agent-cannot-be-correctly-installed-or-configured/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2012 10:23:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/vsphere-ha-agent-for-host-hosts-name-has-an-error-in-clusters-name-in-datacenters-name-vsphere-ha-agent-cannot-be-correctly-installed-or-configured/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a lesson in checking the basics!

Of course you can seize control of the folder by taking ownership and pushing down from a top level - but how do you preserve the existing Access Control Lists?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>SCOM 2007 R2: Daily Health Check Script</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/01/scom-2007-r2-daily-health-check-script/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2012 16:59:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/01/scom-2007-r2-daily-health-check-script/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An updated version of this script has been released: &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/05/scom-2007-r2-daily-health-check-script-v2/"&gt;https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/05/scom-2007-r2-daily-health-check-script-v2/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/01/MSFT-System-Center-logo_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with a Microsft SCOM PFE (Premier Field Engineer) for the last few months and part of the engagement is an environment health check for the SCOM setup. Based on this Microsoft recommend a series of health checks to for the environment that should be carried out every day. This is summarised as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the health of all Management Servers and Gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the RMS is not in maintenance mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Outstanding Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Agent&amp;rsquo;s Health Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Backup Status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review any Management Group Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review the Pending Management status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Database Sizes (Operations, Data warehouse, ACS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Volume of Alerts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review Alert Latency&lt;/li&gt;

As with a lot of Management Packs, to get the most out of it you need to have a dedicated RunAs account with local admin permissions on the servers you are monitoring (e.g. for the Backlogged Files reporting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easy (and wrong) option here is to go with the less secure option and distribute a RunAs account to ALL servers. There are lots of reasons why you wouldn’t want to distribute the credentials to &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; server in your SCOM installation – but just from a security standpoint, you shouldn’t do it! Selecting the “More Secure” option and distributing credentials only to servers which will require them is a much safer bet.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>More notes on Threat Management Gateway Arrays</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/08/more-notes-on-threat-management-gateway-arrays/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2011 19:57:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/08/more-notes-on-threat-management-gateway-arrays/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/03/TMG2010.png" alt=""&gt;It seems that despite my previous &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/installing-exchange-2010-edge-server-with-forefront-protection-for-exchange-fpe-and-threat-management-gateway-tmg-part-1/" title="Installing Exchange 2010 Edge Server with Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) – Part 1"&gt;experiences&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/configuring-sstp-vpn-connections-threat-management-gateway-2010/" title="Configuring SSTP VPN connections to Threat Management Gateway 2010"&gt;TMG 2010&lt;/a&gt;, I still stumble when &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/11/in-depth-installing-and-configuring-threat-management-gateway-2010-in-a-network-load-balanced-array/" title="In-depth: Installing and Configuring Threat Management Gateway 2010 in a Network Load Balanced Array"&gt;creating a TMG array&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the limitations that caused headaches was that it used to have a maximum storage of 4GB, which was the database limit.

&lt;p&gt;Having recently managed several Exchange 2010 migration projects, one of the best new features which really sells it to systems administrators is the Online Archive. “No more managing PST files? When can we have it installed by?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, once they’ve purchased licensing for Exchange 2010 and installed and configured the server, migrated the users’ mailboxes and decommissioned the old Exchange 2003 server, the Online Archive feature is not available. The users have been enabled, and as of SP1 we have a separate Archive mailbox database configured on slow (cheap) storage, but the Online Archive is nowhere to be found in Outlook. If the users log on using OWA, lo and behold the Online Archive is available.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exchange 2010 – CreateTestUser : Mailbox could not be created.

There are a couple of reasons for the changes, all of which are aimed at increasing the presence and visitor numbers on this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branding. Whether I like it or not, “McGeown” is not easy to spell or remember so I wanted to move away from it as an identity. After some discussion with my friend and creative advisor &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Matt Hellyer&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;, I picked DefinIT.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’d like to add some more bloggers to the site – the number of visitors is directly in proportion to the number of posts, and I can’t post as much as I’d like to. I will introduce those bloggers as and when they arrive, but they will be people I know and trust – with real technical expertise. (That said, if you’re reading and are interested in writing for DefinIT, please contact me!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually I’d like to use McGeown.co.uk for a more personal site, aimed at family and friends. That’s what it was originally aimed at, and hopefully one of these days I’ll get the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to let me know what you think about the new theme, new name and new URL in the comments below. This blog will always be dedicated to providing high quality IT help on a broad range of subjects, as ever, I hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Reporting all ActiveSync devices and their Users in Exchange 2010</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/reporting-all-activesync-devices-and-users-in-exchange-2010/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2011 14:28:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/02/reporting-all-activesync-devices-and-users-in-exchange-2010/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2011/02/Exchange-2010-Logo-748516_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;Recently I needed to report on the ActiveSync devices that were attached to our Exchange 2010 organisation, and which users they were accessing, and then export them to a CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s pretty simple to install in a domain environment – you run the installer to create a collection server, then activate the forwarder on the client servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to servers you really want to audit, those that are by definition more at risk from security breach because they are publicly accessible, it’s not so straightforward. Take for example that web server, or FTP host in your DMZ, certainly not domain joined and probably bombarded by daily brute force password attacks.

&lt;p&gt;Getting a certificate for either a Gateway Server or remotely monitored Server can be a touch vexing. If you’re installing on the same domain as the SCOM management server the security settings take care of themselves, not so for non-domain servers, which require mutual certificate authentication.

&lt;p&gt;Upgrade the VM’s tools, if you haven’t already. This requires a re-boot, but don’t reboot, shut the server down down, otherwise you’ll require another reboot to add the feature.

All our domain users have a userfolder on the server, it’s mapped as z:\ and there is a folder redirection set up. It’s pretty standard in a corporate/domain environment, so why does it cause so many Vista installations to fail?&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;If you&amp;amp;rsquo;re using UAC (User Account Control) you might need to map the network drive as the administrator. This is a pain in the @$$ because you have to disconnect the drive under your user account first. Of course, if you&amp;amp;rsquo;ve got ANY documents open, this will upset your profile. Anyway, steps for that: &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Disconnect the currently mapped drive. &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Open the command prompt as the administrator. Type &amp;quot;net use \\[server]\share and check that it&amp;amp;rsquo;s mapped by typing &amp;amp;ldquo;net use&amp;amp;rdquo;.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
 
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Open explorer and navigate to your shared folder and right click, use the &amp;amp;ldquo;Map Network Drive&amp;amp;rdquo; wizard to map the share under your user profile. &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;font size=&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;If all above fails (as in my case), your only option is to log in as a user that doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t map drives (machine local admin works for me, but then you have to enable that user as it&amp;amp;rsquo;s disabled by default. You also have to provide a password for it - don&amp;amp;rsquo;t forget to disable again after an install.)&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/font&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/ol&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;

When installing the SP1 I was elevating my standard user credential rather than running as the domain admin.
