At the time it was just a self-learning and self-documentation exercise, but after few short months Sam started noticing an increasae in traffic and that people were commenting on the posts he wrote. From that point on the blog became about helping other people who were hitting the same problems.
Fast forward to 2011 and Sam invited Simon Eady to join and co-author on the site, creating a wider set of expertise but still with the same goal of sharing the knowledge and helping people just like us.</description></item><item><title>Looking forward to VMware Explore - the artist formerly known as VMworld</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/07/looking-forward-to-vmware-explore-the-artist-formerly-known-as-vmworld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/07/looking-forward-to-vmware-explore-the-artist-formerly-known-as-vmworld/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that my first VMworld was almost 9 years ago! I feel very blessed to have attended in 2014 (EU), 2015 (EU), 2016 (US), 2017 (EU), 2018 (my first as an employee), 2019 (my first time as a speaker!), and virtually in 2020 and 2021.
Over the years VMworld has been hugely formative in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve talked many times before about how the trajectory of my career really took off when I got involved with the London VMUG, and how that led to being awarded vExpert in 2013.</description></item><item><title>Forwarding Tanzu Kubernetes Grid logs to vRealize Log Insight Cloud using the Fluent-bit Package</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/forwarding-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-logs-to-vrealize-log-insight-cloud-using-the-fluent-bit-package/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/forwarding-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-logs-to-vrealize-log-insight-cloud-using-the-fluent-bit-package/</guid><description>In my previous post I walked through configuring kubernetes ingress with automatically generated SSL certificates and DNS registration using Tanzu Kubernetes Grid&amp;rsquo;s Packages. Another of the packaged applications available is Fluent-bit, which enables log forwarding from your Kubernetes cluster and workloads to a range of supported logging endpoints.
There are a couple of tweaks required in order to forward logs to vRealize Automation Log Insight Cloud. We need to use the HTTP output in the Fluent Bit configuration to forward the logs as a JSON payload to the Log Insight API.</description></item><item><title>Ingress, SSL and DNS using TKG 1.4 Packages on TKGs Clusters</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2021/12/ingress-ssl-and-dns-using-tkg-1.4-packages-on-tkgs-clusters/</guid><description>So, you&amp;rsquo;ve set up your shiny new Workload Management on vSphere, created a Namespace and deployed a cluster&amp;hellip;now what?!

However, applications being applications, sometimes they become less responsive than they should (or for example, when my Synology updates itself and reboots, any mounted NFS volumes can cause the running pods to degrade in performance). This isn&amp;rsquo;t an issue with service liveliness, which can be mitigated with a liveness probe that restarts the pod if a service isn&amp;rsquo;t running.</description></item><item><title>Automatically adding Kubernetes Service DNS records to Microsoft DNS using CoreDNS and k8s_gateway</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/12/automatically-adding-kubernetes-service-dns-records-to-microsoft-dns-using-coredns-and-k8s_gateway/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2020/12/automatically-adding-kubernetes-service-dns-records-to-microsoft-dns-using-coredns-and-k8s_gateway/</guid><description>When I deploy a new service into a namespace, I need to create a new DNS record that makes it available.

The current integration also enables a method to deploy micro-segmentation out of the box, based on dynamic Security Group membership and the Service Composer. This method does have some limitations, and can be inflexible for the on-going management of deployed applications. It requires in-depth knowledge and understanding of NSX and the Distributed Firewall, as well as access to the Networking and Security manager that is hosted by vCenter Server.</description></item><item><title>NSX-T 2.0 Lab Build: Upgrading to NSX-T 2.1</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/12/nsx-t-2-0-lab-build-upgrading-to-nsx-t-2-1/</guid><description>Yesterday saw the release of NSX-T 2.1, with some new features and also some usability enhancements.

It&amp;rsquo;s fair to say, that I&amp;rsquo;ve made mistakes along the way - and learned a lot of lessons as to what makes a deployment a success.
In the end, pretty much everything comes down to getting the pre-requisites right. Nothing that I&amp;rsquo;ve written here is not already documented in the official documentation, and the installation wizard does a huge amount of the work for you.</description></item><item><title>So long, and thanks for all the fish…</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 16:06:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/07/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for Xtravirt for over 3 and a half years now, first as a Senior Consultant, and more recently as a Lead Consultant.

The diagram below shows the architecture of the solution.
Deploying vCHA can be done in two modes - &amp;ldquo;Basic&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo;. You can use Basic mode if the vCenter you want to be HA is managing the hosts it resides on - in this scenario the wizard configures your vCenter and deploys the Passive and Witness nodes for you.</description></item><item><title>Alexa, turn on my workload cluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2017 15:05:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/alexa-turn-on-my-workload-cluster/</guid><description>I already have a vRealize Orchestrator workflow to shutdown my workload cluster.

I have lost count of the number of times I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked to help troubleshoot an issue that, when asked, people don&amp;rsquo;t know which log they should be looking at. The simple fact is that vRealize Automation has a lot of log files. Correlating these log sources to provide an overall picture is a painful, manual process - unless you have Log Insight!</description></item><item><title>Lab notes: Upgrading vSphere 6.0 and NSX 6.2 to vSphere 6.5a and NSX 6.3</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 14:07:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/lab-notes-upgrading-vsphere-6-0-and-nsx-6-2-to-vsphere-6-5a-and-nsx-6-3/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been holding off upgrading my lab to vSphere 6.5 because NSX 6.2.x doesn&amp;rsquo;t support it.

The sequence of the upgrade is slightly different to the generic one published by VMware because vSphere 6.5 isn&amp;rsquo;t supported with NSX 6.2.

This is good for a couple of reasons - firstly is availability. If we were to lose a host, and an NSX Edge, the route will time out quicker than NSX Edge High Availability - thus providing higher availability for our network traffic.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator Workflow: shutdownVSANCluster</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Dec 2016 13:21:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vro-shutdownvsancluster/</guid><description>My vSphere lab is split into two halves - a low power management cluster, powered by 3 Intel NUCs, and a more hefty workload cluster powered by a Dell C6100 chassis with 3 nodes. The workload servers are noisy and power hungry so they tend to be powered off when I am not using them, and since they live in my garage, I power them on and off remotely.
To automate the process, I wanted to write an Orchestrator workflow (vRO sits on my management cluster and is therefore always on) that could safely and robustly shut down the workload cluster.</description></item><item><title>vRA7.2 and vSphere Integrated Containers</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vra7-2-and-vsphere-integrated-containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2016 15:28:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/12/vra7-2-and-vsphere-integrated-containers/</guid><description>One of the cool new features released with vRealize Automation 7.2 was the integration of VMware Admiral (container management) into the product, and recently VMware made version 1 of vSphere Integrated Containers generally available (GA), so I thought it was time I started playing around with the two.

Note that none of this is official or supported by VMware as far as I know - it&amp;rsquo;s the results of my experimentation which has shown some performance improvement by increasing the configured memory pool.</description></item><item><title>Deploying to AWS with Software Components on vRealize Automation 7</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/deploying-to-aws-with-software-components-on-vrealize-automation-7/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2016 17:09:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/11/deploying-to-aws-with-software-components-on-vrealize-automation-7/</guid><description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on some ideas in my lab to leverage the AWS endpoint on vRealize Automation.

The vRA appliance version I have (6.2 - note to self, need to update lab!) includes the plugin version 1.0.4 for REST. According to the release notes, this was fixed in 1.0.5 - typical!
So the solution is to upgrade the REST API plugin 🙂</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG Ravello Home Lab Winner!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-ravello-home-lab-winner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 11:11:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-ravello-home-lab-winner/</guid><description>First of all, thank you to everyone who came along to my session at the UKVMUG yesterday, it was great to see so many people at a round table discussion, sorry for those that had to stand!

This was my second attempt at VCDX and although the first failure was a painful experience, the lessons learned from it were invaluable to take into the defence the second time around. Failing doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a negative experience - if there is one thing that I will take from the VCDX program it is that there is ALWAYS more I need to learn, and I can always do better.</description></item><item><title>#VMworld2015: vRealize Automation 7 Briefing Notes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-vrealize-automation-7-briefing-notes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Oct 2015 08:20:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/10/vmworld2015-vrealize-automation-7-briefing-notes/</guid><description>@vaficionado) – if that list of names doesn’t fill you with confidence for vRA.Next, then I suggest you follow them on twitter and trust me that it’s a crack team!

What I didn’t want to do was simply edit the connections directly – quite often with the VMware appliances there are scripts on start-up to ensure the configuration is correct and consistent – what I wanted was to be able to find a more supported and reliable way.</description></item><item><title>Resetting the vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller root password</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 13:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/07/resetting-the-vsphere-6-platform-services-controller-root-password/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how supported this is, but this process can recover a vSphere 6 vCenter Server Appliance or Platform Services Controller when you&amp;rsquo;ve lost the root password.

I&amp;rsquo;m developing some very large, very complicated workflows for vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO), and as it&amp;rsquo;s a Java based application it will probably come as no surprise to many that the performance of the client drops off sharply as the client&amp;rsquo;s RAM usage creeps up.
When working on some of the larger workflows, or after long sessions and heavy clipboard use, the client would become (even more) sluggish and in some cases would freeze entirely.</description></item><item><title>3DES Password Based Encryption with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/3des-password-based-encryption-with-vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2015 21:38:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/3des-password-based-encryption-with-vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco/</guid><description>A requirement that often arises in large, complex orchestration projects is the need to encrypt and decrypt information. One such requirement recently specified triple DES password based encryption as the standard, which led me through a lot of Google searches to CryptoJS.
CryptoJS is a growing collection of standard and secure cryptographic algorithms implemented in JavaScript using best practices and patterns. They are fast, and they have a consistent and simple interface.</description></item><item><title>Generating a secure random password with vRealize Orchestrator (vRO/vCO)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/generating-a-secure-random-password-with-vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 21:17:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/generating-a-secure-random-password-with-vrealize-orchestrator-vrovco/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly common requirement when creating a new user to assign a randomly generated password, so during a recent engagement I wrote a little password generator to do that. I wanted to be able to chose whether special characters were used, and the length of the password - typically if the password doesn&amp;rsquo;t used special characters I would increase the length significantly!
Characters should be randomly picked from:
a-z A-Z 0-9 (optional) ASCII special characters Inputs passwordLength - the length of the password to be generated (number) excludePunctuation - exclude the use of special characters if TRUE (boolean) Outputs generatedPassword - the generated password (SecureString) The SecureString type prevents the string from being displayed in the workflow attributes - it can be used as a normal string, but will be asterisk&amp;rsquo;d when displayed.</description></item><item><title>vRealize Orchestrator (vCO) Multi-node Plug-in use case: Remote Site Selection and Execution</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-operations-vco-multi-node-plug-in-use-case-remote-site-selection-and-execution/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 16:46:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/01/vrealize-operations-vco-multi-node-plug-in-use-case-remote-site-selection-and-execution/</guid><description>One of the use cases I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on with a customer is based on the vRO/vCO multi-node plug-in and involves the master vRO/vCO node calling proxy workflows based on a parameter - in this case the target site.

The VMware vCenter Orchestrator Multi-Node Plug-In allows organizations to manage environments with multiple vCenter Orchestrator server instances.
As organizations increase their level of automation, they often find the need to deploy multiple Orchestrator instances. With the VMware vCenter Orchestrator Multi-Node Plug-In, administrators have a more efficient way to manage multiple Orchestrator instances from a central point. The plug-in allows administrators to log in to a master Orchestrator server to view the inventories and workflows of remote Orchestrator servers, and to trigger workflows remotely.</description></item><item><title>Configuring a vRO/vCAC PowerShell host with Basic Authentication</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/12/configuring-a-vrovcac-powershell-host-with-basic-authentication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2014 15:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/12/configuring-a-vrovcac-powershell-host-with-basic-authentication/</guid><description>To add a Windows Server 2012 R2 PowerShell host using Basic Authentication only, follow these steps.

This week, while using the SSL Certificate Automation Tool and Derek’s script, I encountered a couple of things I felt could be improved for a more complex environment.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Learning Veeam Backup and Replication for VMware vSphere</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/book-review-learning-veeam-backup-and-replication-for-vmware-vsphere/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2014 11:23:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/05/book-review-learning-veeam-backup-and-replication-for-vmware-vsphere/</guid><description>I was recently sent a copy of Christian Mohn&amp;rsquo;s new book &amp;ldquo;Learning Veeam Backup and Replication for VMware vSphere&amp;rdquo; to review, and as ever this is my honest opinion of this book.

If you happen to be using CA signed certificates on your “protected site” vCenter and “recovery site” vCenter servers, when you come to linking the two SRM sites you encounter SSLHandShake errors – basically SRM assumes you want to use certificates for authentication because you’re using signed certificates. If you use the default self-signed certificates, SRM will default to using password authentication (see SRM Authentication).</description></item><item><title>VCSA 5.5 Web Client fails to log on with &amp;ldquo;SSL certificate verification failed&amp;rdquo;</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2014 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/vcsa-5-5-web-client-fails-to-log-on-with-ssl-certificate-verification-failed/</guid><description>This had me scratching my head, what seemed to be a common problem wasn’t fixed by the common solution.

If you’re using less than the recommended 8GB RAM there are additional steps to change the heap size for performance.</description></item><item><title>Installing VMware vSphere Update Manager Download Service and publishing via IIS</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/installing-vmware-vsphere-update-manager-download-service-and-publishing-via-iis/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2013 15:30:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/06/installing-vmware-vsphere-update-manager-download-service-and-publishing-via-iis/</guid><description>The vSphere UMDS provides a way to download patches for VMware servers that have an air-gap, or for some reason aren’t allowed to go out to the internet themselves – in my case a security policy prevented a DMZ vCenter Server from connecting to the internet directly.

Doing this on any more than a few hosts is tedious work – even on two hosts it seems like a waste of time logging on the host via SSH (or even enabling it first) before changing the password. Then we also need to audit the change, there’s no point making it for compliance reasons if we can’t then prove we did it!</description></item><item><title>Awarded vExpert 2013 – and vote for Simon!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/awarded-vexpert-2013-and-vote-for-simon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 May 2013 09:24:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/awarded-vexpert-2013-and-vote-for-simon/</guid><description>I am absolutely thrilled to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve been awarded vExpert 2013 - it&amp;rsquo;s such an honour to be listed among these others and hopefully I can continue to contribute throughout the year.

Why does it require multiple certificates for my vCenter server? In short, each service requires a certificate because it could feasibly be on a server (or servers) of it&amp;rsquo;s own - take this hypothetical design - each role is hosted on it&amp;rsquo;s own VM, and there are 7 certificates required - SSO, Inventory Service, vCenter Server, Orchestrator, Web Client, Log Browser and Update Manager.</description></item><item><title>Updating ESXi Fibre Channel HBA Drivers via VMware Update Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 May 2013 14:41:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2013/05/updating-esxi-fibre-channel-hba-drivers-via-vmware-update-manager/</guid><description>A problem reared it&amp;rsquo;s head over the weekend with one of our hosts&amp;rsquo; Fibre Channel HBAs negotiating it&amp;rsquo;s way down to 2GB, and consequently introducing massive latency for the LUNs behind it.

So far the roles installed for Exchange 2010 are CAS, Hub and Mailbox on a single server. Into this mix I need to introduce an Edge Server, with message hygiene in the form of Forefront Protection for Exchange (FPE) and Threat Management Gateway (TMG) as a reverse proxy to publish OWA, ActiveSync et-al.
Since Edge, FPE and TMG can now all exist on a single 64-bit server, I will start with a clean installation of Windows Server 2008 R2, up to date with all the latest hot fixes.</description></item><item><title>Unable to access Outlook Web Access (OWA) after installing Update Rollup 1, 2, 3 or 4 – flogon.js errors</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/unable-to-access-outlook-web-access-owa-after-installing-update-rollup-1-2-3-or-4-flogon-js-errors/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2010 11:02:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/08/unable-to-access-outlook-web-access-owa-after-installing-update-rollup-1-2-3-or-4-flogon-js-errors/</guid><description>If you’re having trouble accessing OWA after updating Exchange 2010 with any of the Rollup packages, try this:
Uninstall the update package from the Programs and Features control panel
Download the package file directly from Microsoft, don’t use Windows Update
Open a command prompt or PowerShell prompt as Administrator
Navigate to the location of the package (.msp) and run from the elevated command prompt.
Apparently when Windows update installs the package it doesn’t run it with the elevated privileges to write to the folder in the Exchange program files – why, I have no idea!</description></item><item><title>Passed Microsoft Exams 70-662 and 70-663 – Now officially MCITP: Enterprise Messaging Administrator</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/passed-microsoft-exams-70-662-and-70-663-now-officially-mcitp-enterprise-messaging-administrator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2010 09:49:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/passed-microsoft-exams-70-662-and-70-663-now-officially-mcitp-enterprise-messaging-administrator/</guid><description>On Monday I took the two Exchange 2010 exams, “70-662 TS: Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, Configuring” and “70-663 PRO: Deploying Messaging Solutions with Microsoft Exchange Server 2010” and I am pleased to say that I passed both of them, scoring an 812 on the 70-662 and 960 on the 70-663.

In Site4 there is an Exchange 2007 SP2 server (CAS, Mailbox, HT). All the connectors required worked as expected, and inter-site routing works as expected.
I introduced into the mix a 2010 Enterprise server (CAS, Mailbox, HT) to Site1 as a prelude to a full upgrade of the site to Exchange 2010.</description></item><item><title>Exchange ActiveSync fails on iPhone after upgrade to iOS4</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2010 15:55:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/07/exchange-activesync-fails-on-iphone-after-upgrade-to-ios4/</guid><description>I’ve spent a fair bit of time today trying to sort out my iPhone sync to my Exchange Server, failing miserably.

After testing on my local IIS 7 and working perfectly, I uploaded the updates to my live blog and hit the “Migrate to IIS 7” button, which promises it will be completed in 24h.</description></item><item><title>Creating a Windows Server 2008 Microsoft Cluster Service SQL Active/Passive Cluster on a single ESXi 4.0 Server</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/01/creating-a-windows-server-2008-microsoft-cluster-service-sql-activepassive-cluster-on-a-single-esxi-4-0-server/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2010 14:52:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2010/01/creating-a-windows-server-2008-microsoft-cluster-service-sql-activepassive-cluster-on-a-single-esxi-4-0-server/</guid><description>Configuring the Virtual Environment and Virtual Machines Note – this configuration will work for ESXi 4 upwards due to the server 2008 MSCS requirement for persistent SCSI-3 reservations.
The first step is to create a new vSwitch for the host-only cluster heartbeat network, don’t assign any network adaptors to the switch as it’s going to be local only.
Create a new virtual machine with a single hard disk. For the purposes of this test, I’ve assigned 2 vProcessors, 1GB RAM, 30GB drive for the OS, 1 vNIC in the default vSwitch0.</description></item><item><title>Syncing email, calendar and tasks over a laptop, desktop and iPhone</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/12/syncing-email-calendar-and-tasks-over-a-laptop-desktop-and-iphone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Dec 2009 16:58:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2009/12/syncing-email-calendar-and-tasks-over-a-laptop-desktop-and-iphone/</guid><description>In the past, I would often say to my wife, “if it’s not in Outlook, it isn’t going to happen”.

Microsoft have a KB article about it, which has worked in some cases, but not in most.</description></item><item><title>Free vector graphics</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/free-vector-graphics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2008 08:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2008/09/free-vector-graphics/</guid><description>If, like me, you enjoy a bit of design in your free time then I have a great site for you…

You should always perform a backup on a server you can&amp;rsquo;t afford to lose BEFORE any operation that could potentially destroy the disk (think what would happen if you had a power cut while resizing&amp;hellip;) Step 1 - Moving the Virtual Server.</description></item><item><title>DRM Free iTunes music with QTFairUse</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/drm-free-itunes-music-with-qtfairuse/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jun 2007 19:41:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/drm-free-itunes-music-with-qtfairuse/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go into the rights and wrongs of DRM, I will say that I&amp;rsquo;m strongly against piracy and if your intention is to strip DRM for those kind of reasons, kindly go somewhere else for your info.

My current set up at work means that I am maintaining one version of our web site while working on developing a new one - not uncommon. I have 2 virtual servers running Server 2003, IIS and SQL Server, each an identical copy of our production server.

It appears that the dlls are not registered correctly, there&amp;rsquo;s a KB article from Microsoft&amp;nbsp;that contains a script to reregister the dlls. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple fix: Copy and paste the following script into a text document, save it as RegisterAdminPack.</description></item><item><title>Installing Visual Studio 2003 on Vista Enterprise</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-on-vista-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2007 19:37:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/06/installing-visual-studio-2003-on-vista-enterprise/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as you might imagine if you&amp;rsquo;re going to be developing on a local machine. The pre-requisites include IIS and FrontPage Server Extensions which will need installing. Install IIS on Vista Go through Control Panel, Programs and Features, then select &amp;ldquo;Turn Windows features on or off&amp;rdquo; on the left hand menu. The basic installation of Vista from the control panel will not be sufficient for a VS install, you must add&amp;nbsp;IIS Metabase Compatibility (you&amp;rsquo;ll see why later),&amp;nbsp;.</description></item><item><title>Office 2007 woes</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/05/office-2007-woes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 May 2007 20:33:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2007/05/office-2007-woes/</guid><description>Originally published Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 Wahey!

It came to the point when I needed to remove XP and solely rely on Vista. Some might say that&amp;rsquo;s brave, others foolish, others still insane.
