 Sam McGeown
&lt;/a&gt;. At the time it was just a self-learning and self-documentation exercise, but after few short months Sam started noticing an increasae in traffic and that people were commenting on the posts he wrote. From that point on the blog became about helping other people who were hitting the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 2011 and Sam invited &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/authors/simon-eady"&gt;
 Simon Eady
&lt;/a&gt; to join and co-author on the site, creating a wider set of expertise but still with the same goal of sharing the knowledge and helping people just like us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware Cloud Expert - Multi-Cloud Builder</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/11/vmware-cloud-expert-multi-cloud-builder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/11/vmware-cloud-expert-multi-cloud-builder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I had the good fortune to be invited to attend a VMware Multi-Cloud course at VMware UK HQ in Staines.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course took place over 4 days and was very well structured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialy, we were given the VMware vision on Multi-Cloud and then we were straight into the &amp;ldquo;good stuff&amp;rdquo; hands-on-labs. This would be a consistent and well executed theme for the 4 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VMware now have an impressive global cloud presence utilising their partnerships with major hyperscalers such as AWS, Azure Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud, and several others. You can see from the list below VMware are serious about this Multi-Cloud journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VMware Aria - Unified Multi-Cloud Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/09/vmware-aria-unified-multi-cloud-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2022/09/vmware-aria-unified-multi-cloud-management/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;VMWorld, sorry VMware Explore has been and gone and seemed to go very smoothly, there were several announcements but the big one for me was Aria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we are growing as an organisation, opportunities are surfacing on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My focus in the last 24 months has shifted from a more project to project focus to now being involved in several projects at once providing project and architectural governance as well as normal consultant duties.

&lt;p&gt;I have been in IT for over 20 years now and in truth the first 10 years were not so great (perhaps a story for another time) but it was when I stumbled upon the vCommunity by way of Twitter and then subsequently I attended my first VMUG (in London) which completely challenged and changed my way of thinking and approach to my career. Talking to and observing peers whom I respected gave me a lot of inspiration to re-evaluate what I was doing in my career, why I did what I was doing and perhaps most importantly of all was I really being the best I can be?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCAP7-CMA Design Exam Experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/02/vcap7-cma-design-exam-experience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2019 13:56:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2019/02/vcap7-cma-design-exam-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For the last month I had been preparing for the VCAP7-CMA Design exam and I am very glad to say I passed on my first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly I found it slightly easier than the VCP7-CMA but that I suspect is down to the fact I spend a lot of my time designing and implementing solutions for customers as opposed to day to day administration of any given solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sure if you ask that question to ten people you will get 10 different answers, or at the very least a wide variety of reasons. The product chosen to deliver the solution was a poor match, the product was implemented incorrectly, the PM sucked, the Vendor gave no support, insufficient training material/resources, poor interoperability, the list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One issue I have observed from time to time on my travels is quite different from the above listed examples.

&lt;p&gt;While we all know that, automating day to day operations tasks is becoming the choice of an IT organization, it is hard for them to find a solution which can completely understand their business policies and provide them the efficiency they need from automating simple operational tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our research, we found that, one of the most time consuming activity done by an Virtual Infrastructure Administrator is to juggle resources between the changing business requirements and ensure that every VM which is being hosted in their environment is &lt;strong&gt;BEING SERVED WELL&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Looking forward to #VMworld EMEA 2017</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/looking-forward-to-vmworld-emea-2017/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2017 09:30:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/09/looking-forward-to-vmworld-emea-2017/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/09/VMworld-2017.jpg" alt=""&gt;Having missed last years VMworld I feel very ready for attending the EMEA VMworld in Barcelona.&lt;/p&gt;

Would they need a management pack or is this something vROps can do out of the box?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer to this is yes, but it is not immediately obvious how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a great many metrics that come with a vanilla build of vROps but not all of them are enabled a good example of these are the sensor metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Announcing Part 2 – #vROps Webinar series 2017 – “Full Stack” monitoring with vRealize Operations Manager</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/announcing-part-2-vrops-webinar-series-2017-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 07:50:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/announcing-part-2-vrops-webinar-series-2017-full-stack-monitoring-with-vrealize-operations-manager/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/03/logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;As promised, vROps Webinar Series 2017 is back with the second episode of the year. Last time around we looked closely into the features of vROps 6.5 and as stated during that webinar, we will now show you how you can unlock the full capabilities of vROps using the extensibility of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been following the Webinar Series, by now you have a complete visibility into the capabilities of vROps, when it comes to monitoring the vSphere infrastructure. While this infrastructure is important for the IaaS provider, what business cares about is Applications. The good news is that vROps provides you an extensible platform which can be leveraged to extend the product capability into any area where metrics exist. This could be at the layers of your Software Defined Datacenter such as Compute, Network &amp;amp; Storage, or in the Application Stack and it&amp;rsquo;s tiers such as App, Web and DB.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps hidden gem – XML Builder</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-hidden-gem-xml-builder/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Apr 2017 08:06:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-hidden-gem-xml-builder/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;If you spend a good amount of time in vROps either at your place of work or with customers (like me) you will likely  have had to create some custom XML (metric configuration) for custom dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past you would either use the sample/examples to get them started and then go and find the specific metric names while, this was usually quite time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent versions of vROps however, VMware have introduced a &amp;ldquo;builder&amp;rdquo; to help you properly format and slect the corect adapters/adapterkinds and metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar Series 2017 – Part 1 – What’s New with vROps 6.5</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2017 09:02:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/04/vrops-webinar-series-2017-part-1-whats-new-with-vrops-6-5/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/03/logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;Time to share the recording of the first episode of the vROps Webinar Series 2017.

&lt;p&gt;HA is a great feature and in my opinion should be considered seriously with any deployment (where possible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does HA protect your Master node (which essentially behaves as an index for your vROps cluster and if lost will render your cluster dead unless you have a working backup of your cluster) it will also allow your cluster to tolerate a data node failure.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you are familiar with vROps you will know that when you deploy it you have &amp;ldquo;T-Shirt&amp;rdquo; sizes to choose from, Small, Medium, Large and now Extra Large (6.5). However an additional extra in 6.5 is support to increase the memory allocation of your vROps nodes, you will not require additional CPU for the node until you hit the next node size bracket. If in doubt check the &lt;a href="https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&amp;amp;cmd=displayKC&amp;amp;externalId=2093783" target="_blank"&gt;

We are here and we are charged up to give you some more dope on vRealize Operations manager in the year 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

What do I mean? Well each year there is the new hotness, the next thing/innovation you are told you need or should have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases the innovations and new tech are ground breaking awesomeness and most certainly offer new opportunities for the infrastructure masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am all for progress, if you are not moving forward and regularly looking for sensible ways to improve what you do and the infrastructure you use then I really do think you are in the wrong industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vSAN Cache Performance Dashboard in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/vsan-cache-performance-dashboard-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Feb 2017 14:09:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2017/02/vsan-cache-performance-dashboard-in-vrops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2017/02/vsan.jpg" alt=""&gt;I have recently been able to get vSAN properly up and running in my lab and took a look at the OOTB Dashboards that come with the MPSD (&lt;a href="https://solutionexchange.vmware.com/store/products/vrealize-operations-management-pack-for-storage-devices" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK so here it is, one thing I have observed for a good while now is how much noise there is about how -you- should be in the cloud (Public) and if you are not you&amp;rsquo;re already dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call Bull****!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public, Hybrid and Private clouds are &lt;strong&gt;solutions&lt;/strong&gt; not final destinations, regardless of whether you are a customer, partner, or any other third thing you should be purely focused on what is best for you or (if you provide IT services) your customer. It is plainly obvious to me that in -all- of the customers I have visited there has been no appetite or reason to mass adopt any single one solution/option as it simply would not fit how they do business and function day to day. There will of course be exceptions to this rule but they are indeed exceptions not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How do you keep -your- IT skills relevant without burn out?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2016 08:52:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/10/how-do-you-keep-your-it-skills-relevant-without-burn-out/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/10/skills.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For the past 8 months, we have give pretty deep into most of the product features and we believe it is time when we review the product in it&amp;rsquo;s current form and shape.

However 9/10 customers wanted to use SNMP and with vROps it was a question of switching on the fire-hose and pointing it to the receiver and let that end point or middle-ware handle the torrent of data. This was naturally not always well received and in some cases rendered that option as a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Whats new in #vROps 6.3 part 2</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/whats-new-in-vrops-6-3-part-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2016 21:16:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/08/whats-new-in-vrops-6-3-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I will drill down to look at &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;some&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; of the enhancements, improvements and or new additions one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this time around we will move our focus from vROps as a Product and related features to the concept of running your SDDC operations with vRealize Operations Dashboards. Just to clarify, this is not a session where we will teach you to create dashboards, but this is a session where we would share how a set of Customised Dashboards can help any organisation&amp;rsquo;s IT to get an insight into Storage, Network &amp;amp; Compute within your SDDC. While vROps is primarily a Performance Management and Capacity Planning tool, we will take you to the other important aspects as well such as Availability and Configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Part 7 : Working with Alerts &amp; Symptoms</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2016 09:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;Time to release the recording for the latest part of the vROps Webinar Series. We completed the 7th session of the series where we spoke about vRealize Operations Manager Alerts and Symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alerts as we all know would always remain the heart and soul for the operations teams to run the data centers, whether old school or the modern software defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all cases you need alerts and more importantly you need meaningful and actionable alerts. In this part of the series, Simon and myself concentrated on making you aware of the alert constructs in vROps and as usual share experiences around how we help customers leverage the strong feature set of vROps to customize alerts and related symptoms, recommendations and actions to drastically reduce the Mean Time to Resolution of issues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 7 : Working with Alerts &amp; Symptoms</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2016 17:54:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/07/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-7-working-with-alerts-symptoms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;Time to announce the next part of the year long webinar series on vRealize Operations Manager. With the last part of the series, we started focusing on content withing vROps. We will continue the trend and talk about a major function of vROps a.k.a Alerts. Alerts is the most used and most ab-used part of vROps, and with this session we want to give you some insights on the entire life-cycle of the alerting function of vROps.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Part 6 : Understanding vROps SuperMetric &amp; Views</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/06/vrops-webinar-2016-part-6-understanding-vrops-supermetric-views/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jun 2016 22:42:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/06/vrops-webinar-2016-part-6-understanding-vrops-supermetric-views/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;

Sure its quite self indulgent but seeing other people&amp;rsquo;s lists gives you a small glimpse into their life. After all musical taste is a hugely personal thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I approached my top 10 by considering which bands and albums had the biggest impact on me at a given time in my life and that I still enjoy today. It was kinda cool to go through my own play lists and see what &amp;ldquo;oldies&amp;rdquo; cropped up still in my current playlists of which I listen to on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 : Part 5 : Design and Deployment considerations</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/vrops-webinar-2016-part-5-design-and-deployment-considerations/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2016 13:25:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/vrops-webinar-2016-part-5-design-and-deployment-considerations/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;As promised, I am posting the recording for the 5th Session of vROps Webinar Series 2016.

 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; Sunny
&lt;/a&gt; and I thought about discussing Architecture of vROps. To some, it might sound strange as for smaller deployments you might not have to worry about Sizing and Architecture much since it is pretty simple to install and configure a small or a medium node for a small shop. However as your monitoring needs grow and you start adding solutions for monitoring data sources beyond vSphere, you would need to think about scaling up or scaling out. As your monitoring environment weaves into your incident ticketing system, you would start to see the need to HA of vROps and as you have a DR strategy for your workloads, you will start thinking about DR for your operations tools as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What if I want full metrics? in #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:06:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/05/what-if-i-want-full-metrics-in-vrops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo.jpg" alt=""&gt;If you have used vCOps (previous version of vROPs) you will likely remember the option in the admin panel where you could change the number of metrics being collected from &amp;ldquo;balanced&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;full&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many found, this option drop down was not present in vROps and there appeared to be no replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However what if you want to scale up your node or nodes, going from say small to medium?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reasons why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps your POC has proved so useful you want to move it into production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have lots of really useful historical on your existing smaller build and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to redeploy (therefore losing your historical data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have limitations where scaling out is simply not an option but you need vROps to take on more work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are likely other compelling reasons for you to want to scale up your vROps nodes so lets look at how we can do that.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps Webinar 2016 – Announcing Part 4 : Contention Based Performance &amp; Capacity Management</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2016 11:33:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/04/vrops-webinar-2016-announcing-part-4-contention-based-performance-capacity-management/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;We hope you are having fun with the &lt;a href="https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/starting-2016-with-a-bang-vrops-webinar-series/" target="_blank"&gt;

 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; the last session
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; we would now take you to the world of vRealize Operations Policies Policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Policy??&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;A &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A &lt;strong&gt;policy&lt;/strong&gt; is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source - &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy" target="_blank"&gt;
 &lt;clr-icon shape="pop-out" size="12"&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt; Wikipedia
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the role of vRealize Operations Manager is to help you with Performance &amp;amp; Capacity Management of your Software Defined Datacenter (SDDC), it is important that you feed in the guiding principles of your Business Environment into vROps to get the rational outcomes. These outcomes span across Health, Risk &amp;amp; Efficiency of your SDDC environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.2 – upgrade and utilization dashboards</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:25:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2upgrade-and-utilization-dashboards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;As you will see the upgrade is simple and even though its early days I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen anything that has been broken!&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;i class="fas fa-hashtag"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will be doing this upgrade on a VA so to begin with I will need the vRealize Operations Manager - Virtual Appliance Operating System upgrade .pak file (Realize_Operations_Manager-VA-OS-6.2.0.3445569.pak)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps 6.2 what&amp;rsquo;s new?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2-whats-new/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jan 2016 07:25:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-6-2-whats-new/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;vRealize Operations 6.2 was released last night and is now available for &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VROPS-620&amp;amp;productId=563&amp;amp;rPId=10016" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at what’s new very quickly there are some good new enhancements but when you compare this to the 6.1 release it’s perhaps a little light, nevertheless there appears to be some new cool features and enhancements to be had in this version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any sizing/scale increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading from existing 6.1 versions can be done via a .pak file.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#vROps a new diva in the datacentre</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-a-new-diva-in-the-datacentre/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2016 16:06:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrops-a-new-diva-in-the-datacentre/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vRealize-Operations-Manager-Logo_thumb.jpg" alt=""&gt;For the last few months and certainly very recently (at the London VMUG meeting) I have had the chance to talk to peers and #vExperts and share “war stories” with regards to vRealize Operations Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has become a consistent theme in all the stories is just how much compute resources vROps requires when you “go big” and not just what is clearly defined in the sizing spreadsheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example some of the large deployments I have either been involved in or heard about (to monitor upwards and beyond of 30000 VMs) required the deployment of Large vROps nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>vRealize Operations Webinar Series : 2015 :Part 1 : Building Self Healing Environments with #vROps</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrealize-operations-webinar-series-2015-part-1-building-self-healing-environments-with-vrops/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2016 10:20:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2016/01/vrealize-operations-webinar-series-2015-part-1-building-self-healing-environments-with-vrops/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2016/01/CZFR4nKUsAADI5G.png" alt=""&gt;A series of webcasts on vRealize Operations Manager 6.x, helping you learn about anything and everything about the solution. Some of the examples include, vROps Policies, Alert Definitions, Automated Action Framework, integration to third party etc. This would include power point and live demonstrations. The session would range anywhere between 60 to 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 100+ registrations and more than 70 live attendees, it was definitely a great start to this series.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 nodes if you are on versions 6.0.x&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16 nodes if you are on version 6.1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter if you plan to use SNMP with your vROps cluster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite simple really, what I discovered today is that even though you have a master node SNMP traps can and will be sent from all of the nodes to the destination you have configured.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>#UKVMUG &amp;ndash; Curry &amp;ndash; Beer &amp;ndash; Sessions &amp;ndash; Weddings</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:25:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/11/ukvmug-curry-beer-sessions-weddings-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/11/vmug-usercon_thumb.png" alt=""&gt;This was my second UKVMUG and it was my first vCurry evening! so I was really looking forward to getting up to the event and seeing everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bits I will cover briefly in this post are..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrading from 6.0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EPO functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dashboards&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have the guys at VMware added? I have listed what I consider the hi-lights below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The maximum of 8 nodes has been doubled to 16!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSO integration has been added (requires vSphere 6.0)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the following are my thoughts and bullet points for you to consider when faced with same dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VCE Vision, vCOPs to vROps migration</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/vce-vision-vcops-to-vrops-migration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2015 22:26:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/vce-vision-vcops-to-vrops-migration/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/08/vce-logo-large.png" alt=""&gt;Recently I have been working with various products that compliment or are accessed by vCOPs/vROps via Management packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vROps is still fairly new in comparative terms to other products like vCOPs and VCE Vision, when planning migrations from vCOPs to vROps it is naturally important to check compatibility and what is required for a successful migration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are doing a greenfield deployment of vROps there is nothing to be concerned about, you simply need the VCE Vision appliance running version 2.6.1-2.6.5 and have the latest Management Pack installed on your vROps cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>My VCAP5-DCD experience</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/my-vcap5-dcd-experience/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 08:59:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/08/my-vcap5-dcd-experience/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/08/VCAP-DCD-1.jpg" alt=""&gt;A few months ago I decided to tackle the VCAP5-DCD exam and when booking I gave myself 2 months to study before the date of the exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was keenly aware that at least in this calendar year the VCAP5-DCD exam and undergone some changes E.G. it no longer had multiple choice questions (think VCP5-DCV in terms of format)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a wealth of knowledge out there from people whom had either passed/failed or were currently studying so it didn&amp;rsquo;t take too long to get an understanding of what disciplines/knowledge VMware were looking for in the exam.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Automate the deployment of vROps (supporting vDS)</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/05/automate-the-deployment-of-vrops-supporting-vds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2015 12:50:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2015/05/automate-the-deployment-of-vrops-supporting-vds/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2015/05/powercli-logo.png" alt=""&gt;Recently I have been looking at &lt;a href="http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/" title="VirutallyGhetto" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you do uninstall and remove PernixData from your hosts your Path Selection Polices do not revert back to your original configuration rather they revert back to the default vSphere setting of MRU (Most recently used).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What about VSAN for SMB/SME?</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/what-about-vsan-for-smbsme/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2014 15:30:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/what-about-vsan-for-smbsme/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware2.jpg" alt=""&gt;Unless you have been sleeping under a rock you will be aware that VSAN was launched last week and has gone &lt;a href="http://cto.vmware.com/the-dawn-of-vsan/" title="The Dawn of Virtual SAN" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt; and from what I have seen so far I do think VSAN is a great product and I think VMware have done a superb job with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;-many-&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; discussions on twitter and other channels regarding the then lack of licensing information and pricing I was eager to see if VMware would offer a &amp;ldquo;foundation&amp;rdquo; VSAN option for SMB/SME&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>How to backup and restore your ESXi host config</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/how-to-backup-and-restore-your-esxi-host-config/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 19:15:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2014/03/how-to-backup-and-restore-your-esxi-host-config/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware.jpg" alt=""&gt;There are many ways to tackle the problem of quickly redeploying or recovering ESXi hosts, Host profiles, Auto deploy etc.. however such options are either out of reach for SME/SMB users where their license does not cover such features or they have very small clusters of which Auto deploy etc would perhaps be considered overkill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how can we backup the config of our ESXi hosts? There is a great command you can use in &lt;a href="https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/details?productId=285&amp;amp;downloadGroup=VSP510-VCLI-510" title="vSphere CLI download" target="_blank"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without wishing to bore the pants off of any would be reader I shall summarize my ruminations as someone whom is still quite new to the VMware world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is a a couple of recent meetings I have had with VMware. Learning that they are now very keen to engage with &amp;rsquo;the rest of us&amp;rsquo; and by that I mean those of us working in SME&amp;rsquo;s as we represent well over 50% of their business revenue. For me personally this was excellent news as we have already invested heavily into the VMware product range and plan to carry on doing so in the future. The recent release of VMware suites was a good step forward but I still feel they need to do a lot better in communicating to SME&amp;rsquo;s about their vast (and ever increasing) product range as there are many gems that can often go unoticed. Our discovery of vCops earlier this year was a good example of this.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Host disk write latency errors – troubleshooting</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2012 11:02:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/10/host-disk-write-latency-errors-troubleshooting/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/VMware3.jpg" alt=""&gt;So recently we upgraded our cluster monitoring suite to it&amp;rsquo;s latest iteration (Veeam ONE), it was not long before I began to receive emails from the monitor informing me of Host disk write latency &amp;ldquo;errors&amp;rdquo; (Datastore write latency had exceeded the defined threshold in the monitor) on several of the Datastores on our SAN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I began the process of cross referencing backup routines and any heavy I/O routines that may have been running at the time the warning messages were generated. My conclusion was that even under average load these alerts were being generated, which was far from ideal even if we had not noticed any performance problems with any of the busy VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Site to Site VPN Tunnel traffic flow problems</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/site-to-site-vpn-tunnel-traffic-flow-problems/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Aug 2012 10:58:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2012/08/site-to-site-vpn-tunnel-traffic-flow-problems/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Firewalls being used – Sonicwall 3500 &amp;amp; Cisco 506e&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several months ago we relocated and it was then necessary to setup a Site to Site VPN tunnel with another network. (In this instance the other network was not directly managed by us)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon the creation of the tunnel and after successful traffic tests all looked well. However after several hours or less in some cases traffic stopped flowing yet both firewalls reported the tunnel as “up”. We reviewed the first and second phase settings and tweaked the Sonicwall VPN settings to hopefully remedy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A work/learn balance</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/a-worklearn-balance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2011 10:50:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/06/a-worklearn-balance/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As with all things IT the pace of technology change is relentless and we are constantly and rightly told that change is good and that being able to evolve and move with the times is an important skill and ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However I am often left wondering how we can maintain a balance. I have all to often seen IT professionals falling into the trap chasing the latest and greatest and rushing to try to implement or learn new emerging technologies without much thought to what they already have.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Keep it simple stupid!</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/keep-it-simple-stupid/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2011 10:57:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/keep-it-simple-stupid/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/11/iisselfsignedcertificatelogo.png" alt=""&gt;I am a firm believer in trying to keep things simpler where ever possible (but not for the sake of it) In years gone by I have heard many admins lament about the complexities of deploying IIS to work alongside third party plugins such as PHP. I can remember numerous occasions where I have wrestled with the config and &amp;ldquo;best practice&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am however glad to say finally Microsoft have taken notice of this and produced a very simple and effective deployment toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A start is a start</title><link>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/a-start-is-a-start/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2011 11:04:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.definit.co.uk/2011/03/a-start-is-a-start/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;So here &lt;img src="https://www.definit.co.uk/images/2010/07/simonsml.jpg" alt=""&gt;we go, my very first tech blog… so what on earth do I start with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given I am unlikely to have any profound revelations I shall simply focus on what I have discovered as useful and helpful on my travels!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up then…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been asked on many occasions by individuals and SMEs should they opt for a brand such as HP over Dell or vice versa… as ever my default response is a brief needs analysis. It seems all to often folk get caught up by hearsay/brand loyalty over suitability.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
